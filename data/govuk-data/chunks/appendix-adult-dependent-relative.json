If the decision maker is satisfied that all the suitability and eligibility requirements for settlement as an Adult Dependent Relative are met, the applicant will be granted settlement.\n\n1.   ADR 14.2. If the requirements for settlement are not met, but the decision maker believes the applicant is likely to meet all the suitability and eligibility requirements for permission to stay as an Adult Dependent Relative, the application will be varied by the Secretary of State to an application for temporary permission to stay as an Adult Dependent Relative, and where this happens: \n    1.   (a) no additional application fee for the application for permission to stay will be required and the settlement application fee will not be refunded; and\n    2.   (b) the Secretary of State will write to the applicant informing them of this variation and will request the applicant pay the required Immigration Health Charge.\n\nADR 14.3. If the applicant does not pay the requested Immigration Health Charge, the application for permission to stay will be rejected as invalid and the applicant will not be refunded the fee paid for the settlement application.\n\nADR 14.4. Where an application is varied and the applicant meets the requirements for permission to stay the applicant will be granted permission to stay which expires on the same date as their sponsor’s permission, or, if the sponsor is a British Citizen or settled in the UK, the applicant will be granted permission for 30 months.\n\n1.   ADR 14.5. If the applicant is granted permission to stay, it will be subject to the following conditions: \n    1.   (a) no access to public funds; and\n    2.   (b) work allowed (including self-employment and voluntary work); and\n    3.   (c) study allowed subject to the ATAS requirement in Appendix ATAS.\n\nADR 14.6.
