This table relates to points options A-E set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 1 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options A to E refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   • the rate shown by the median ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   • £17.13 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where £17.13 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £17.13 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\n| SOC 2020 occupation code |

It mandates that going rates are based on median ASHE data or a minimum of £17.13/hour, whichever is higher, with only the full going rate relevant for settlement applications.

This table relates to points options A-E set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 1 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options A to E refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   • the rate shown by the median ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   • £17.13 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where £17.13 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £17.13 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\n| SOC 2020 occupation code |

This table relates to points options F-J set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 2 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options F to J refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   • the rate shown by the 25th percentile ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   • £12.82 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where £12.82 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £12.82 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\nEquivalent SOC 2010 occupation codes are included where they were previously eligible for the Skilled Worker route, for ease of matching to the relevant SOC 2020 occupation codes for applicants being sponsored to continue working in the same occupation.\n\n| SOC 2020 occupation code | Equivalent SOC 2010 occupation code(s) | Examples of related job titles (non-exclusive) | Going rate (SW – options F and I, GBM

It requires employers to pay going rates based on the higher of ASHE 25th percentile data or £12.82/hour, pro-rated for working hours. Only the full going rate applies for settlement applications, with specific thresholds and exceptions detailed.\n\n### Table 2: Eligible SOC 2020 occupation codes and related going rates based on 25th percentile Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data\n\nThese SOC 2020 occupation codes are considered to be skilled to Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 6 or above, and are eligible for the Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility and Scale-up routes. This table relates to points options F-J set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 2 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options F to J refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   • the rate shown by the 25th percentile ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   • £12.82 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where £12.82 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £12.82 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\nEquivalent SOC 2010 occupation codes are included where they were previously eligible for the Skilled Worker route, for ease of matching to the relevant SOC 2020 occupation codes for applicants being sponsored to continue working in the same occupation.\n\n| SOC 2020 occupation code | Equivalent SOC 2010 occupation code(s) | Examples of related job titles (non-exclusive) | Going rate (SW – options F and I, GBM
