(c) not have been used in a previous application which was either granted or refused (but can have been used in a previous application which was rejected as invalid, made void or withdrawn); and\n    4.   (d) not have been withdrawn by the sponsor or cancelled by the Home Office; and\n    5.   (e) confirm that the role meets the requirements at RW 4.3; and\n    6.

RW 4.2. The requirements of the resident labour consideration are: \n    1.   (a) that the role is supernumerary, such that it is over and above the sponsor’s normal staffing requirements and if the person filling the role was not there, it would not need to be filled by anyone else (with a full explanation of why it is supernumerary); or\n    2.   (b) that the role involves living mainly within and being a member of a religious order, which must be a lineage of communities or of people who live in some way set apart from society in accordance with their specific religious devotion, for example an order of nuns or monks; or\n    3.   (c) that the sponsor holds national records of all available individuals, details of those records and confirms that the records show that no suitable settled worker is available to fill the role; or\n    4.   (d) that a national recruitment search was undertaken, and the following details are provided: \n        1.   (i) where the role was advertised, which must be at least one of the following: \n            1.   (1) a national form of media appropriate to the sponsor’s religion or denomination; or\n            2.   (2) the sponsor’s own website, if that is how the sponsor usually reaches out to its community on a national scale, that is where it normally advertises vacant positions, and the pages containing the advertisement are free to view without paying a subscription fee or making a donation; or\n            3.   (3) Jobcentre Plus (or in Northern Ireland, Job Centre Online) or in the employment section of a national newspaper, if there is no suitable national form of media appropriate to the sponsor’s religion or denomination; and\n\n        2.   (ii) any reference numbers of the advertisements; and\n        3.   (iii) the period the role was advertised for, which must include at least 28 days during the six month period immediately before the date the sponsor assigned the Certificate of Sponsorship to the applicant; and\n        4.   (iv) confirmation that no suitable settled workers are available to be recruited for the role.\n\n3.   RW 4.3. The sponsor must ensure the role meets all the following requirements: \n    1.   (a) the role must involve performing religious duties within, or directed by, the sponsor’s organisation to support the activities of the religious institution; and\n    2.   (b) the religious duties must not include work which falls under a role of a Minister of Religion (which means the applicant must not have core duties of leading a congregation in performing the rites and rituals of the faith and in preaching the essentials of the creed).\n\nRW 4.4. The sponsor must be authorised by the Home Office to sponsor the job in question under the Religious Worker route.\n\nRW 4.5. The sponsor must be listed as A-rated on the Home Office’s register of licensed sponsors, unless the applicant was last granted permission as a Religious Worker and is applying to continue working for the same sponsor as in their last permission.\n\nRW 4.6. The decision maker must not have reasonable grounds to believe the job the applicant is being sponsored to do does not comply with the National Minimum Wage Regulations or the Working Time Regulations."
