Key conditions include previous serious criminal convictions, participation in crimes against peace, or acts contrary to UN principles; exceptions are not specified.\n\n### Exclusion from humanitarian protection\n\n1.   339D. An asylum applicant is excluded from a grant of humanitarian protection for the purposes of paragraph 339C(iv) where the Secretary of State is satisfied that there are serious reasons for considering that the asylum applicant: \n    1.   (i) has committed, instigated or otherwise participated in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; or\n    2.   (ii) has committed, instigated or otherwise participated in the commission of a serious non-political crime outside the UK prior to their admission to the UK as a person granted humanitarian protection; or\n    3.   (iii) has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations; or\n    4.   (iv) having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime (as defined in Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002), constitutes a danger to the community of the UK; or\n    5.   (v) is a danger to the security of the UK.\n\n2.   339DA. In 339D(ii): \n    1.   (i) the reference to a serious non-political crime includes a particularly cruel action, even if it is committed with an allegedly political objective; and\n    2.   (ii) the reference to a crime being committed by a person outside the UK prior to their admission to the UK as a person granted humanitarian protection includes a crime committed by that person at any time up to and including the day on which they are issued with a relevant biometric immigration document by the Secretary of State.\n\n3.   339DB. For the purposes of 339DA(ii), a relevant biometric immigration document is a document that: \n    1.   (i) records biometric information (as defined in section 15(1A) of the UK Borders Act 2007); and\n    2.   (ii) is evidence of leave to remain in the United Kingdom granted to a person as a result of being granted humanitarian protection.\n\n4.   339E. If the Secretary of State decides to grant humanitarian protection to a person who has previously been given leave to enter (whether or not the leave has expired), or to a person who has entered without leave, the Secretary of State will vary the existing leave or grant limited leave to remain.
