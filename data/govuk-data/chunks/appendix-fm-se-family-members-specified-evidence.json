      "text": "### Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM\n\n1.   13. Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to the applicable provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.7., E-ECC.2.1., E-ECC.2.5., E-LTRC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.5. will, subject to paragraph 21A of this Appendix, be calculated in the following ways: \n    1.   (a) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application, has been employed by their current employer for at least 6 months and has been paid throughout the period of 6 months prior to the date of application at a level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the level relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of: \n        1.   (i) The level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        3.   (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner.\n\n    2.   (b) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application and has been employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), their gross annual income will be the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        3.   (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner. In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.\n\n    3.   (c) Where the person is the applicant’s partner, is in salaried employment outside of the UK at the date of application, has been employed by their current employer for at least 6 months, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person’s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a); and also\n        2.   (ii) On that basis but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning.\n\n    4.   (d) Where the person is the applicant’s partner, has been in salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months of the date of application, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person’s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a) but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning; and also\n        2.   (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 15(b).\n\n    5.   (e) Where the person is self-employed, their gross annual income will be the total of their gross income from their self-employment (and that of their partner if that person is in the UK with permission to work), from any salaried or non-salaried employment they have had or their partner has had (if their partner is in the UK with permission to work), from specified non-employment income received by them or their partner, and from income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner, in the last full financial year or as an average of the last two full financial years. The requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to these forms of income shall apply as if references to the date of application were references to the end of the relevant financial year(s). The relevant financial year(s) cannot be combined with any financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 applies and vice versa.\n    6.   (f) Where the person is self-employed, they cannot combine their gross annual income at paragraph 13(e) with specified savings in order to meet the level of income required under Appendix FM.\n    7.   (g) Where the person is not relying on income from salaried employment or self-employment, their gross annual income will be the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        2.   (ii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner.\n\n    8.   (h) Where the person is the applicant’s partner and is in self-employment outside the UK at the date of application and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person’s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a) but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning; and also\n        2.   (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(e).\n\n    9.   (i) Any period of unpaid maternity, paternity, adoption, parental or sick leave in the 12 months prior to the date of application will not be counted towards any period relating to employment, or any period relating to income from employment, for which this Appendix provides.\n    10.   (j) The provisions of paragraph 13 which apply to self-employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies and to a person in receipt of such income.\n    11.   (k) Where the application relies on the employment income of the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must be calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or under sub-paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15, and not under a combination of these methods.\n\n2.   14. Where the requirements of this Appendix and Appendix FM are met by the combined income or cash savings of more than one person, the income or the cash savings must only be counted once unless stated otherwise.\n3.   15. In respect of paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 13(d), the provisions in this paragraph also apply: \n    1.   (a) In order to evidence the level of gross annual income required by Appendix FM, the person must meet the requirements in paragraph 13(b) or paragraph 13(d)(i); and\n    2.   (b) The person must also meet the level of gross annual income required by Appendix FM on the basis that their income is the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross income from salaried employment in the UK or overseas earned by the person in the 12 months prior to the date of application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by the person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application;\n        3.   (iii) The gross amount received from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension by the person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        4.   (iv)The person cannot combine the gross annual income at paragraph 15(b)(i)-(iii) with specified savings in order to meet the level of income required.\n\n4.   16. Where a person is in receipt of maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or has been so in the 6 months prior to the date of application, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) the relevant date for considering the length of employment with their current employer will be the date that the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick leave commenced or the date of application; and\n    2.   (b) the relevant period for calculating income from their salaried employment will be the period prior to the commencement of the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or to the date of application.\n\n5.   17. If a person is an equity partner, for example in a law firm, the income they draw from the partnership (including where this is in the form of a profit share) will be treated as salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM.\n6.   17A. Where a person is a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme administered by HMRC and does not rely on paragraph 13(e), the income they receive as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme may be treated as income from salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM. In that case, the requirements for specified evidence in paragraph 2 must be met, subject to applying those requirements so as to reflect the person’s status as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme.\n7.   18. When calculating income from salaried employment under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 16, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Basic pay, skills-based allowances, and UK location-based allowances will be counted as income provided that: \n        1.   (i) They are contractual; and\n        2.   (ii) Where these allowances make up more than 30% of the total salary, only the amount up to 30% is counted.\n\n    2.   (b) Overtime, payments to cover travel time, commission-based pay and bonuses (which can include tips and gratuities paid via a tronc scheme registered with HMRC) will be counted as income, where they have been received in the relevant period(s) of employment or self-employment relied upon in the application.\n    3.   (bb) In respect of a person in salaried employment at the date of application, the amount of income in sub-paragraph (b) which may be added to their gross annual salary, and counted as part of that figure for the purposes of paragraph 13(a)(i) or 13(b)(i), is the annual equivalent of the person’s average gross monthly income from that income in their current employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application.\n    4.   (c) Payments relating to the costs of UK or overseas travel, including (for example) travelling or relocation expenses and subsistence or accommodation allowances, and payments made towards the costs of living overseas, will not be counted as income.\n    5.   (d) Gross income from non-salaried employment will be calculated on the same basis as income from salaried employment, except as provided in paragraph 18(e) and 18(f), and the requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to salaried employment shall apply as if references to salary were references to income from non-salaried employment. Non-salaried employment includes that paid at an hourly or other rate (and the number and/or pattern of hours required to be worked may vary), or paid an amount which varies according to the work undertaken, whereas salaried employment includes that paid at a minimum fixed rate (usually annual) and is subject usually to a contractual minimum number of hours to be worked.\n    6.   (e) For the purpose of paragraph 13(a)(i), in respect of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application “the level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application” shall be no greater than the annual equivalent of the person’s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application, where that employment was held throughout that period.\n    7.   (f) For the purpose of paragraph 13(b)(i), “the gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application” of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application shall be considered to be the annual equivalent of: \n        1.   (aa) the person’s gross income from non-salaried employment in the period immediately prior to the date of application, where the employment has been held for a period of no more than one month at the date of application; or\n        2.   (bb) the person’s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment, where the employment has been held for a period of more than one month at the date of application.\n\n    8.   (g) For the purpose of paragraphs 13(c)(ii) and 13(d)(i), “the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning” of a person who is returning to the UK to take up non-salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return is the gross annual income from that employment, based on the rate or amount of pay, and the standard or core hours of work, set out in the document(s) from the employer provided under paragraph 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 18(b), this may include the gross “on-target” earnings which may be expected from satisfactory performance in the standard or core hours of work.\n\n8.   19. When calculating income from self-employment under paragraphs 12A and 13(e), and in relation to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) There must be evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of application.\n    2.   (b) Where the self-employed person is a sole trader or is in a partnership or franchise agreement, the income will be the gross taxable profits from their share of the business in the relevant financial year(s), not including any deductable allowances, expenses or liabilities which may be applied to the gross taxable profits to establish the final tax liability.\n    3.   (c) Where income to which paragraph 19 applies is being used to meet the financial requirement for an initial application for leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM by an applicant who used such income to meet that requirement in an application for entry clearance as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner under that Appendix in the last 12 months, the Secretary of State may continue to accept the same level and evidence of income to which paragraph 19 applies that was accepted in granting the application for entry clearance, provided that there is evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of the application for leave to remain.\n    4.   (d) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 7 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Statement(s) of Account (SA300 or SA302) relates.\n    5.   (e) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Company Tax Return(s) CT600 relates.\n\n9.   20. When calculating income from specified non-employment sources under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 15, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Assets or savings must be in the name of the person, or jointly with their partner.\n    2.   (b) Any asset or savings on which income is based must be held or owned by the person at the date of application.\n    3.   (c) Any rental income from property, in the UK or overseas, must be from a property that is: \n        1.   (i) owned by the person;\n        2.   (ii) not their main residence and will not be so if the application is granted, except in the circumstances specified in paragraph 20(e); and\n        3.   (iii) if ownership of the property is shared with a third party, only income received from their share of the property can be counted.\n\n    4.   (cc) The amount of rental income from property received before any management fee was deducted may be counted.\n    5.   (d) Equity in a property cannot be used to meet the financial requirement.\n    6.   (e) Where the applicant and their partner are resident outside the UK at the date of application, rental income from a property in the UK that will become their main residence if the application is granted may only be counted under paragraph 13(c)(i) and paragraph 13(d)(ii).\n    7.   (f) Any future entitlement to a maintenance grant or stipend of the type specified in paragraph 10(g) may be counted as though the person had received the annual amount of that grant or stipend in the 12 months prior to the date of application.\n\n10.   20A. When calculating the gross annual income from pension under paragraph 13, the gross annual amount of any pension received may be counted where the pension has become a source of income at least 28 days prior to the date of application.\n11.   21. When calculating income under paragraphs 13 to 16, the following sources will not be counted: \n    1.   (a) Loans and credit facilities.\n    2.   (b) Income-related benefits: Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Support (or any equivalent) and income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance.\n    3.   (c) The following contributory benefits: contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit.\n    4.   (cc) Unemployability Allowance, Allowance for a Lowered Standard of Occupation and Invalidity Allowance under the War Pension Scheme.\n    5.   (d) Child Benefit.\n    6.   (e) Working Tax Credit.\n    7.   (f) Child Tax Credit.\n    8.   (ff) Universal Credit.\n    9.   (g) Any other source of income not specified in this appendix.",

Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to the applicable provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.7., E-ECC.2.1., E-ECC.2.5., E-LTRC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.5. will, subject to paragraph 21A of this Appendix, be calculated in the following ways: \n    1.   (a) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application, has been employed by their current employer for at least 6 months and has been paid throughout the period of 6 months prior to the date of application at a level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the level relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of: \n        1.   (i) The level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application;\n        2.

(iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner.\n\n    2.   (b) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application and has been employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), their gross annual income will be the total of: \n        1.

(i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a); and also\n        2.   (ii) On that basis but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning.\n\n    4.   (d) Where the person is the applicant’s partner, has been in salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months of the date of application, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person’s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a) but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning; and also\n        2.   (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 15(b).\n\n    5.   (e) Where the person is self-employed, their gross annual income will be the total of their gross income from their self-employment (and that of their partner if that person is in the UK with permission to work), from any salaried or non-salaried employment they have had or their partner has had (if their partner is in the UK with permission to work), from specified non-employment income received by them or their partner, and from income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner, in the last full financial year or as an average of the last two full financial years. The requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to these forms of income shall apply as if references to the date of application were references to the end of the relevant financial year(s). The relevant financial year(s) cannot be combined with any financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 applies and vice versa.\n    6.

(j) The provisions of paragraph 13 which apply to self-employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies and to a person in receipt of such income.\n    11.   (k) Where the application relies on the employment income of the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must be calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or under sub-paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15, and not under a combination of these methods.\n\n2.   14. Where the requirements of this Appendix and Appendix FM are met by the combined income or cash savings of more than one person, the income or the cash savings must only be counted once unless stated otherwise.\n3.   15. In respect of paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 13(d), the provisions in this paragraph also apply: \n    1.

Where a person is in receipt of maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or has been so in the 6 months prior to the date of application, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) the relevant date for considering the length of employment with their current employer will be the date that the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick leave commenced or the date of application; and\n    2.   (b) the relevant period for calculating income from their salaried employment will be the period prior to the commencement of the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or to the date of application.\n\n5.   17. If a person is an equity partner, for example in a law firm, the income they draw from the partnership (including where this is in the form of a profit share) will be treated as salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM.\n6.   17A. Where a person is a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme administered by HMRC and does not rely on paragraph 13(e), the income they receive as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme may be treated as income from salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM. In that case, the requirements for specified evidence in paragraph 2 must be met, subject to applying those requirements so as to reflect the person’s status as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme.\n7.   18. When calculating income from salaried employment under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 16, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Basic pay, skills-based allowances, and UK location-based allowances will be counted as income provided that: \n        1.   (i) They are contractual; and\n        2.   (ii) Where these allowances make up more than 30% of the total salary, only the amount up to 30% is counted.\n\n    2.   (b) Overtime, payments to cover travel time, commission-based pay and bonuses (which can include tips and gratuities paid via a tronc scheme registered with HMRC) will be counted as income, where they have been received in the relevant period(s) of employment or self-employment relied upon in the application.\n    3.   (bb) In respect of a person in salaried employment at the date of application, the amount of income in sub-paragraph (b) which may be added to their gross annual salary, and counted as part of that figure for the purposes of paragraph 13(a)(i) or 13(b)(i), is the annual equivalent of the person’s average gross monthly income from that income in their current employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application.\n    4.   (c) Payments relating to the costs of UK or overseas travel, including (for example) travelling or relocation expenses and subsistence or accommodation allowances, and payments made towards the costs of living overseas, will not be counted as income.\n    5.   (d) Gross income from non-salaried employment will be calculated on the same basis as income from salaried employment, except as provided in paragraph 18(e) and 18(f), and the requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to salaried employment shall apply as if references to salary were references to income from non-salaried employment. Non-salaried employment includes that paid at an hourly or other rate (and the number and/or pattern of hours required to be worked may vary), or paid an amount which varies according to the work undertaken, whereas salaried employment includes that paid at a minimum fixed rate (usually annual) and is subject usually to a contractual minimum number of hours to be worked.\n    6.   (e) For the purpose of paragraph 13(a)(i), in respect of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application “the level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application” shall be no greater than the annual equivalent of the person’s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application, where that employment was held throughout that period.\n    7.   (f) For the purpose of paragraph 13(b)(i), “the gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application” of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application shall be considered to be the annual equivalent of: \n        1.   (aa) the person’s gross income from non-salaried employment in the period immediately prior to the date of application, where the employment has been held for a period of no more than one month at the date of application; or\n        2.   (bb) the person’s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment, where the employment has been held for a period of more than one month at the date of application.\n\n    8.   (g) For the purpose of paragraphs 13(c)(ii) and 13(d)(i), “the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning” of a person who is returning to the UK to take up non-salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return is the gross annual income from that employment, based on the rate or amount of pay, and the standard or core hours of work, set out in the document(s) from the employer provided under paragraph 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 18(b), this may include the gross “on-target” earnings which may be expected from satisfactory performance in the standard or core hours of work.\n\n8.   19. When calculating income from self-employment under paragraphs 12A and 13(e), and in relation to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) There must be evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of application.\n    2.   (b) Where the self-employed person is a sole trader or is in a partnership or franchise agreement, the income will be the gross taxable profits from their share of the business in the relevant financial year(s), not including any deductable allowances, expenses or liabilities which may be applied to the gross taxable profits to establish the final tax liability.\n    3.   (c) Where income to which paragraph 19 applies is being used to meet the financial requirement for an initial application for leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM by an applicant who used such income to meet that requirement in an application for entry clearance as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner under that Appendix in the last 12 months, the Secretary of State may continue to accept the same level and evidence of income to which paragraph 19 applies that was accepted in granting the application for entry clearance, provided that there is evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of the application for leave to remain.\n    4.   (d) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 7 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Statement(s) of Account (SA300 or SA302) relates.\n    5.   (e) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Company Tax Return(s) CT600 relates.\n\n9.   20. When calculating income from specified non-employment sources under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 15, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Assets or savings must be in the name of the person, or jointly with their partner.\n    2.   (b) Any asset or savings on which income is based must be held or owned by the person at the date of application.\n    3.   (c) Any rental income from property, in the UK or overseas, must be from a property that is: \n        1.   (i) owned by the person;\n        2.   (ii) not their main residence and will not be so if the application is granted, except in the circumstances specified in paragraph 20(e); and\n        3.   (iii) if ownership of the property is shared with a third party, only income received from their share of the property can be counted.\n\n    4.   (cc) The amount of rental income from property received before any management fee was deducted may be counted.\n    5.   (d) Equity in a property cannot be used to meet the financial requirement.\n    6.   (e) Where the applicant and their partner are resident outside the UK at the date of application, rental income from a property in the UK that will become their main residence if the application is granted may only be counted under paragraph 13(c)(i) and paragraph 13(d)(ii).\n    7.   (f) Any future entitlement to a maintenance grant or stipend of the type specified in paragraph 10(g) may be counted as though the person had received the annual amount of that grant or stipend in the 12 months prior to the date of application.\n\n10.   20A. When calculating the gross annual income from pension under paragraph 13, the gross annual amount of any pension received may be counted where the pension has become a source of income at least 28 days prior to the date of application.\n11.   21. When calculating income under paragraphs 13 to 16, the following sources will not be counted: \n    1.   (a) Loans and credit facilities.\n    2.   (b) Income-related benefits: Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Support (or any equivalent) and income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance.\n    3.   (c) The following contributory benefits: contribution-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit.\n    4.   (cc) Unemployability Allowance, Allowance for a Lowered Standard of Occupation and Invalidity Allowance under the War Pension Scheme.\n    5.   (d) Child Benefit.\n    6.   (e) Working Tax Credit.\n    7.   (f) Child Tax Credit.\n    8.   (ff) Universal Credit.\n    9.   (g) Any other source of income not specified in this appendix.",

(5) The source of income, financial support or funds must not be a loan, unless evidence submitted with the application shows that: \n    1.

If an applicant applying for limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 or Appendix FM submits an English language test certificate or result and the Home Office has already accepted it as part of a successful previous application in any route (but not where the application was refused, even if on grounds other than the English language requirement), the decision-maker will accept that certificate or result as valid if it is: \n    1.   (a) from a provider which is no longer approved, or\n    2.   (b) from a provider who remains approved but the test the applicant has taken with that provider is no longer approved, or\n    3.   (c) from a test centre which is no longer approved, or\n    4.   (d) past its validity date (if a validity date is required), provided that it is at or above the requisite level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and when the subsequent application is made the award to the applicant does not fall within the circumstances set out in paragraph 32B of this Appendix.",
