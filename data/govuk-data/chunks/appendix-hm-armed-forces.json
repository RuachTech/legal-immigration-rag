An applicant need not meet the requirements in AF 16.1 and instead must provide specified (where “specified” means as specified in Appendix FM-SE to these Rules) evidence from the sources listed in AF 17.5 that they meet the transitional financial requirement at AF 17.3 if: \n    1.   (a) (in the case of dependent partner applications) they have permission as a dependent partner (including as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner) of a member of HM Armed Forces or HM Armed Services leaver at the date of application, if they made an application for entry clearance or permission as such a partner, before 11 April 2024, which was successful;\n    2.   (b) Where the applicant is a dependent child, the parent of the applicant has applied, or is applying for, entry clearance or permission as a dependant partner of a member of HM Armed Forces or and HM Armed Forces service leaver and they meet the requirements of (a) above;\n    3.   (c) the application for entry clearance, permission to enter or permission to stay, as a dependent partner or child has been made before 11 April 2024.\n\nAF 17.2.

AF 17.3. The applicant must provide specified (where “specified” means as specified in Appendix FM-SE to these Rules) evidence from sources listed in AF 17.5. that: \n    1.   (a) the financial requirement in AF 17.4. is met: or\n    2.

(c) where the applicant is a child of a member of HM Armed Forces, or an HM Armed Forces service leaver parent, who has sole parental responsibility for them, the parent can adequately maintain themselves, the applicant and any other children in the UK without recourse to public funds.\n\n1.   AF 17.4. The financial requirement is: \n    1.   (a) a gross annual income of at least: \n        1.   (i) £18,600; and\n        2.   (ii) an additional £3,800 for the first child; and\n        3.

AF 17.5. When determining whether the financial requirement in AF 17.3. or AF 17.4. is met only the following sources will be taken into account: \n    1.   (a) income of the member of HM Armed Forces or HM Armed Forces service leaver from specified employment or self-employment, which, in respect of a person returning to the UK with the applicant, can include specified employment or self-employment overseas and in the UK; or\n    2.

AF 17.6. In AF 17.4. “child” means a dependent child of the applicant or the applicant’s partner who is: \n    1.   (a) under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18 years when they were first granted entry under this route; and\n    2.   (b) applying for entry clearance or leave to remain as a dependant of the applicant or the applicant’s partner, or is in the UK with leave as their dependant; and\n    3.   (c) not a British Citizen, settled in the UK, or in the UK with valid limited leave to enter or remain granted under EU3 or EU3A of Appendix EU to these Rules; and\n    4.   (d) not an EEA national with a right to be admitted to or reside in the UK under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.\n\nAF 17.7.
