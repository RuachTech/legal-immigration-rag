AF 32.1. An applicant need not meet the requirements in AF 31.1. and instead must provide specified evidence from the sources listed in AF 31.3 that they meet the transitional financial requirement at AF 32.3. if: \n    1.   (a) (in the case of dependant partner applications) they have permission as a dependant partner (including as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner) of a member of HM Armed Forces or HM Armed Services leaver at the date of application if they made an application for entry clearance or permission as such a partner before 11 April 2024, which was successful (and that application did not rely on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights following consideration of AF 19.1); or\n    2.   (b) Where the applicant is a dependent child, the parent of the applicant has applied, or is applying for, entry clearance or permission as a dependant partner of a member of HM Armed Forces or an HM Armed Forces service leaver and meets the requirements of (a) above; or\n    3.   (c) the application for settlement has been made before 11 April 2024.\n\nAF 32.2. Where the applicant is a partner, AF 32.1(a) only applies if the applicant is applying for settlement with the same partner as when they were last granted permission (and if applying for settlement with a new partner, the applicant must meet the financial requirement at AF 31.2.).\n\n1.   AF 32.3. The financial requirement is: \n    1.   (a) a gross annual income of at least: \n        1.   (i) £18,600;\n        2.   (ii) an additional £3,800 for the first child; and\n        3.   (iii)an additional £2,400 for each additional child; alone or in combination with:\n\n    2.   (b) specified savings of: \n        1.   (i) £16,000; and\n        2.   (ii) additional savings or an amount equivalent to the amount which is the difference between the gross annual income from the sources listed in AF 30.3.(a) to (d) and the total amount required under AF 31.3(a).; or\n\n    3.   (c) £23,496, where the requirements of AF 32.4. are met.\n\nAF 32.4. Where the financial requirement at AF 32.3.(a) exceeds £23,496 due to the number of children in the family, the applicant will only need to provide evidence of a gross annual income of £23,496.\n\n1.   AF 32.5. In AF 32.3. “child” means a dependent child of the applicant or the applicant’s partner who is: \n    1.   (a) under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18 years when they were first granted entry under this route; and\n    2.   (b) applying for entry clearance or leave to remain as a dependant of the applicant or the applicant’s partner, or is in the UK with leave as their dependant; and\n    3.   (c) not a British Citizen, settled in the UK, or in the UK with valid limited leave to enter or remain granted under EU3 or EU3A of Appendix EU to these Rules; and\n    4.   (d) not an EEA national with a right to be admitted to or reside in the UK under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.",
