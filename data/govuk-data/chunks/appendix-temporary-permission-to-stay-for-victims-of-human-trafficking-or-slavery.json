An applicant for an extension of temporary permission to stay as a victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery must meet the following validity requirements: \n    1.   (a) the applicant must have been served with a positive conclusive grounds decision (as defined by Section 69 (1) of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022); and\n    2.   (b) the applicant must have permission to stay as a victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery, or as a child of a victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery; and\n    3.   (c) the applicant must apply using the correct method as follows: \n        1.   (i) if applying on the basis of VTS 3.1.(a) or VTS 3.1.(b) or any combination of VTS 3.1.(a)-(c), the applicant must apply on the specified form on the gov.uk website: FLR (HRO); or\n        2.   (ii) if applying solely on the basis of VTS 3.1(c) the applicant must apply directly to the relevant Competent Authority as set out on the gov.uk website: Temporary permission to stay for victims of human trafficking and slavery; and\n\n    4.   (d) any required fee must have been paid; and\n    5.   (e) the applicant must be in the UK on the date of application.\n\nVTS 1.2. A person is not required to apply as a victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery but references to “applicant” are to a person who is being considered under this route or who has applied to extend their existing permission to stay as a confirmed victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery, or to extend their existing grant of Modern Slavery Discretionary Leave.\n\nVTS 1.3. Where no application is made because VTS 1.2 applies references to ‘date of application’ are to the date of the conclusive grounds decision, but if the person is applying to extend their permission to stay under this route, the date of application is the date on which they apply to extend their permission to stay under this route."

The requirements to be met by a person for permission to stay on the grounds of being a confirmed victim of Human Trafficking or Slavery are (as set out in Section 65 (2) (a) to (c) of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022), that the grant of permission to stay is necessary for the purpose of: - \n    1.   (a) assisting the person in their recovery from any physical or psychological harm arising from the relevant exploitation; or\n    2.   (b) enabling the person to seek compensation in respect of the relevant exploitation, or\n    3.   (c) enabling the person to co-operate with a public authority in connection with an investigation or criminal proceedings in respect of the relevant exploitation.\n\n2.   VTS 3.2. For the purpose of VTS 3.1 the following apply: \n    1.   (a) “physical or psychological harm” means harm of a type that results in physical trauma to the person; or psychological harm that causes mental or emotional trauma or that causes behavioural change or physical symptoms that require psychological or psychiatric care and where the physical or psychological harm arises from the “relevant exploitation”; and\n    2.   (b) “assisting the person in their recovery” for psychological or physical harm means that the applicant requires support either through the National Referral Mechanism or other services to assist in their recovery from their exploitation (this support does not need to accomplish recovery); and\n    3.   (c) “seeking compensation” means that the person must have made an application for compensation in respect of the relevant exploitation; and\n    4.   (d) “an investigation or criminal proceedings” means an investigation by the public authorities or criminal proceedings within the UK which has been confirmed by the relevant public authority or by the Criminal Prosecution Service; and\n    5.   (e) “relevant exploitation” means the conduct resulting in the positive conclusive grounds decision.\n\n3.   VTS 3.3. Permission to stay is not necessary for the purpose of VTS 3.1(a), as set out in Section 65 (4) (a) of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022: \n    1.   (a) if the Secretary of State considers that the applicant’s need for assistance is capable of being met in a country or territory of which they are a national or citizen; or one to which they may be removed in accordance with an agreement between that country or territory and the UK (which may be, but does not need to be, an agreement contemplated by Article 40(2) of the Trafficking Convention).\n\nVTS 3.4 Permission to stay is not necessary for the purpose of VTS 3.1(b) as set out in Section 65 (4) (b) of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, if the applicant is capable of seeking compensation from outside the UK, and it would be reasonable for them to do so in the circumstances."
