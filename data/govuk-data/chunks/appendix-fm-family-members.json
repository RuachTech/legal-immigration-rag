      "text": "### Purpose\n\nGEN.1.1. This route is for those seeking to enter or remain in the UK on the basis of their family life with a person who is a British Citizen, is settled in the UK, is in the UK with protection status, is in the UK with permission as a Stateless person (and the applicant cannot seek entry clearance or permission as their family member under Appendix Statelessness of these rules), is in the UK with limited leave under Appendix EU, or is in the UK with limited leave as a worker or business person by virtue of either Appendix ECAA Extension of Stay or under the provisions of the relevant 1973 Immigration Rules (or Decision 1/80) that underpinned the European Community Association Agreement (ECAA) with Turkey prior to 1 January 2021. It sets out the requirements to be met and, in considering applications under this route, it reflects how, under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, the balance will be struck between the right to respect for private and family life and the legitimate aims of protecting national security, public safety and the economic well-being of the UK; the prevention of disorder and crime; the protection of health or morals; and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others (and in doing so also reflects the relevant public interest considerations as set out in Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002). It also takes into account the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in the UK, in line with the Secretary of State’s duty under section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009."

In this Appendix “specified” means specified in Appendix FM-SE, unless otherwise stated.\n\nGEN.1.5. If the Entry Clearance Officer, or Secretary of State, has reasonable cause to doubt the genuineness of any document submitted in support of an application, and having taken reasonable steps to verify the document, is unable to verify that it is genuine, the document will be discounted for the purposes of the application.\n\nGEN.1.6. For the purposes of paragraph E-ECP.4.1.(a); E-LTRP.4.1.(a); E-LTRP.4.1A.(a); E-ECPT. 4.1(a); E-LTRPT.5.1.(a); and E-LTRPT.5.1A.(a) the applicant must be a national of Antigua and Barbuda; Australia; the Bahamas; Barbados; Belize; the British Overseas Territories; Canada; Dominica; Grenada; Guyana; Jamaica; Malta; New Zealand; St Kitts and Nevis; St Lucia; St Vincent and the Grenadines; Trinidad and Tobago; or the United States of America.\n\nGEN.1.7.

Paragraphs 277-280, 289AA, 295AA and 296 of Part 8 of these Rules shall apply to this Appendix.\n\nGEN.1.9. In this Appendix:\n\n1.   (a) the requirement to make a valid application will not apply when the Article 8 claim is raised: \n    1.   (i) as part of an asylum claim, or as part of a further submission in person after an asylum claim has been refused;\n    2.   (ii) where a migrant is in immigration detention. A migrant in immigration detention or their representative must submit any application or claim raising Article 8 to a prison officer, a prisoner custody officer, a detainee custody officer or a member of Home Office staff at the migrant’s place of detention; or\n    3.   (iii) in an appeal (subject to the consent of the Secretary of State where applicable); and\n\n2.   (b) where an application or claim raising Article 8 is made in any of the circumstances specified in paragraph GEN.1.9.(a), or is considered by the Secretary of State under paragraph A277C of these rules, the requirements of paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(c) and R-LTRPT.1.1.(c) are not met.\n\nGEN.1.10. Where paragraph GEN.3.1.(2) or GEN.3.2.(3) applies, and the applicant is granted entry clearance or leave to enter or remain under, as appropriate, paragraph D-ECP.1.2., D-LTRP.1.2., D-ECC.1.1., D-LTRC.1.1., D-ECPT.1.2. or D-LTRPT.1.2., that grant of entry clearance or leave to enter or remain will be subject to a condition of no recourse to public funds unless the decision-maker considers, with reference to paragraph GEN.1.11A., that the applicant should not be subject to such a condition.\n\nGEN.1.11. Where entry clearance or leave to enter or remain is granted under this Appendix (and without prejudice to the specific provision that is made in this Appendix in respect of a no recourse to public funds condition), that leave may be subject to such conditions as the decision-maker considers appropriate in a particular case.\n\n1.   GEN.1.11A. Where entry clearance or leave to remain as a partner, child or parent is granted under D-ECP.1.2., D-LTRP.1.2., D-ECC.1.1., D-LTRC.1.1., D-ECPT.1.2. or D-LTRPT.1.2., if the decision maker is satisfied that: \n    1.   (a) the applicant is destitute as defined in section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, or is at risk of imminent destitution; or\n    2.   (b) there are reasons relating to the welfare of a relevant child which outweigh the considerations for imposing or maintaining the condition (treating the best interests of a relevant child as a primary consideration); or\n    3.   (c) the applicant is facing exceptional circumstances affecting their income or expenditure\n\n2.   then the applicant will not be subject to a condition of no access to public funds. If the decision maker is not so satisfied, the applicant will be subject to a condition of no access to public funds.\n\n1.   GEN 1.11B. For the purposes of GEN 1.11A ‘relevant child’ means a person who: \n    1.   (a) is under the age of 18 years at the date of application; and\n    2.   (b) it is clear from the information provided by the applicant, is a child who would be affected by a decision to impose or maintain the no access to public funds condition.\n\nGEN.1.12. In this Appendix, “decision-maker” refers, as the case may be, to the Secretary of State, an Immigration Officer or an Entry Clearance Officer.\n\nGEN.1.13. For the purposes of paragraphs D-LTRP.1.1., D-LTRP.1.2., DILRP.1.2., D-LTRPT.1.1., D-LTRPT.1.2. and D-ILRPT.1.2. (excluding a grant of limited leave to remain as a fiancé(e) or proposed civil partner), where at the date of application the applicant has extant leave as a partner or parent (as applicable) granted under this Appendix, the remaining period of that extant leave up to a maximum of 28 days will be added to the period of limited leave to remain granted under that paragraph (which may therefore exceed 30 months).\n\nGEN.1.14. Where a person aged 18 or over is granted entry clearance or limited leave to enter or remain under this Appendix, or where a person granted such entry clearance or limited leave to enter or remain will be aged 18 before that period of entry clearance or limited leave expires, the entry clearance or leave will, in addition to any other conditions which may apply, be granted subject to the conditions in Appendix ATAS of these rules.\n\nGEN.1.15. Where, pursuant to paragraph D-ILRP.1.2., D-ILRP.1.3., D-ILRPT.1.2. or D-ILRPT.1.3., a person who has made an application for indefinite leave to remain under this Appendix does not meet the requirements for indefinite leave to remain, but the Secretary of State believes they may qualify for limited leave to remain under this Appendix or under Appendix Private Life:\n\n1.   (a) the Secretary of State will instead treat the application for indefinite leave to remain as an application for limited leave to remain; and\n2.   (b) the Secretary of State will notify the applicant in writing of any requirement to pay an immigration health charge under the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015 in relation to that application for limited leave to remain; and\n3.   (c) if any requested immigration health charge is not paid, the application for limited leave to remain will be invalid and will not be considered and the Secretary of State will not refund any fee paid in respect of the application for indefinite leave to remain.\n\nGEN.1.16. Where an application or claim raising Article 8 is considered under Appendix FM and EX.1. applies, the requirements of paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(c) and R-LTRPT.1.1.(c) are not met.\n\nGEN.1.17. An application for settlement as a partner or parent (or the dependent child of a partner or parent) on the basis of a 10-year qualifying period for settlement must meet the requirements under Appendix Settlement Family Life (and the application for settlement will not be considered under this Appendix)."
