Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for limited leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant or Appendix W Worker), and where the applicant:\n\n(a) does not meet the requirements of Part 8 for indefinite leave to remain, (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) and\n\n(b) meets or continues to meet the requirements for limited leave to remain under Part 8 in force at the date of decision,\n\nsubject to compliance with any requirement notified under paragraph A277D(b), further limited leave to remain under Part 8 may be granted of such a period and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems appropriate. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph an applicant last granted limited leave to enter under Part 8 will be considered as if they had last been granted limited leave to remain under Part 8.\n\n(c) DELETED\n\nA277B. Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for limited leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant or Appendix W Worker) and where the application does not meet the requirements for indefinite leave to remain (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) or limited leave to remain under Part 8 in force at the date of decision:\n\n(a) the application will also be considered as a partner, parent or child under Appendix FM (family life) in line with paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRC.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) and under Appendix Private Life; and\n\n(b) if the applicant meets the requirements for leave as a partner, parent or child under the relevant paragraphs of Appendix FM or under Appendix Private Life (except the requirement for a valid application under that route), the applicant will (subject to compliance with any requirement to pay an Immigration Health Charge notified under paragraph A277D(b)) be granted leave. If the applicant meets provisions in both Appendix FM and Appendix Private Life, the applicant will be granted on Appendix Private Life if the applicant is a child or young adult (as that provides a shorter route to settlement), otherwise the applicant will be granted on Appendix FM; and\n\n(c) if the applicant is granted leave under those provisions, the period of the applicant’s continuous leave under Part 8 at the date of application will be counted towards the period of continuous leave which must be completed before the applicant can apply for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B or Appendix Settlement Family Life or Appendix Private Life.\n\nA277C. Subject to paragraphs A277 to A280B and paragraph GEN.1.9. of Appendix FM, the Secretary of State may consider any application to which the provisions of Appendix FM (family life) and Appendix Private life of these rules do not apply, under paragraphs RLTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRC.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) of Appendix FM (family life) and Appendix Private life of these rules.

(a) The Secretary of State will treat that application for indefinite leave to remain as an application for limited leave to remain;\n    2.   (b) The Secretary of State will notify the applicant in writing of any requirement to pay an immigration health charge under the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015; and\n    3.   (c) If there is such a requirement and that requirement is not met, the application for limited leave to remain will be invalid and the Secretary of State will not refund any application fee paid in respect of the application for indefinite leave to remain.\n\nA278 The requirements to be met under Part 8 after 9 July 2012 may be modified or supplemented by the requirements in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.\n\nA279.

(iii) Except, from 1 December 2013, the provisions in paragraph A280(d)(i) continue to apply to persons who were granted entry clearance, limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 before 1 December 2013, and where it is a requirement of Part 8, that leave to enter or remain is extant.\n    3.   (iv) Applications may continue to be made under paragraphs 297 to 316F of Part 8 by the child of a British citizen or settled person who was a full-time member of HM Forces regardless of the date of application and paragraph A280(b) continues to apply to these applications as appropriate.\n    4.   (v) A new application by a dependent relative of a British citizen or settled person who is a full time member of HM Forces may no longer be made under paragraphs 317-319 on or after 1 December 2013.

It allows children not British Citizens to be granted leave matching their parent(s)’ duration, subject to meeting specific requirements; if parents lack valid leave, the child will generally be refused unless both are in the UK and a short 3-month leave is appropriate.\n\n### Leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom\n\n1.   306. A child born in the United Kingdom who is not a British Citizen and who requires leave to enter or remain in the circumstances set out in paragraph 304 may be given leave to enter for the same period as his parent or parents where paragraph 305 (i)(a) applies, provided the Immigration Officer is satisfied that each of the requirements of paragraph 305 (ii)-(v) is met. Where leave to remain is sought, the child may be granted leave to remain for the same period as his parent or parents where paragraph 305 (i)(a) applies, provided the Secretary of State is satisfied that each of the requirements of paragraph 305 (ii)-(iv) is met. Where the parent or parents have or are given periods of leave of different duration, the child may be given leave to whichever period is longer except that if the parents are living apart the child should be given leave for the same period as the parent who has day to day responsibility for him.\n2.   307. If a child does not qualify for leave to enter or remain because neither of his parents has a current leave, (and neither of them is a British Citizen or has the right of abode), he will normally be refused leave to enter or remain, even if each of the requirements of paragraph 305 (ii)-(v) has been satisfied. However, he may be granted leave to enter or remain for a period not exceeding 3 months if both of his parents are in the United Kingdom and it appears unlikely that they will be removed in the immediate future, and there is no other person outside the United Kingdom who could reasonably be expected to care for him.\n3.   308. A child born in the United Kingdom who is not a British Citizen and who requires leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom in the circumstances set out in paragraph 304 may be given indefinite leave to enter where paragraph 305 (i)(b) or (i)(c) applies provided the Immigration Officer is satisfied that each of the requirements of paragraph 305 (ii)-(v) is met. Where an application is for leave to remain, such a child may be granted indefinite leave to remain where paragraph 305 (i)(b) or (i)(c) applies, provided the Secretary of State is satisfied that each of the requirements of paragraph 305 (ii)-(iv) is met.",
