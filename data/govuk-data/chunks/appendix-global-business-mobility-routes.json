If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 70% of the pro-rated going rate, which will be calculated as follows:\n\n0.7 x (the going rate for the occupation code stated in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5).\n\nGTR 9.2. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the health or education SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate (and the going rate will be pro-rated according to the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor, and the pro-rating set out in Appendix Skilled Occupations).\n\nGTR 9.3. The applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.\n\nFor example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week in a SOC 2020 occupation code with a going rate of £37,500 must be paid £42,000 (0.7 x £37,500 x 60 ÷ 37.5) per year, not £33,600 (0.7 x £37,500 x 48 ÷ 37.5)."
