This is in order to verify that the applicant is being genuinely engaged for reasons of continuity. Sponsors may issue Certificates of Sponsorship for performers to enter the UK to undertake post-production work only and provided that such post- production work solely relates to their own role in the film or TV production. For such Certificate of Sponsorship, neither the one month requirement nor prior notice to Equity procedure applies.\nThe Sponsor must be able to supply documentary proof that the performer has worked on, or will be working on, the same production outside the UK for at least a month e.g. contracts, press cuttings, cast lists, etc\n\n2.The performer has international status\n\nThe sponsor must be able to provide proof the applicant is known internationally, or they have demonstrable international box-office appeal e.g. press cuttings, awards, accolades, publicity material, television/radio interviews, film and TV credits; or documentary proof that the performer has demonstrable international box-office appeal through international box office figures for films they have starred in or led as a principal performer.\n\n3. Highly specialist or unusual roles\n\nFor certain highly specialist or unusual roles, it may not be possible or reasonable to recruit from the UK because the role requires specific or specialist attributes, including but not limited to: physical appearance; physical talent and linguistic or vocal skills. In such circumstances, where appropriate, Sponsors should first attempt to conduct searches in the UK as set out in category 3 to a reasonable degree. However, it is recognised that the extent of such searches within the UK shall be proportionate to the rarity and specialty of the attributes of the role. The Sponsor must be able to provide proof:\n\n• that the role requires certain highly specialist attributes; and\n\n• that the performer possesses those attributes; and\n\n• of the casting process and casting considerations; and\n\n• of reasonable and appropriate searches in the UK (if applicable); and\n\n• a list of any UK candidates who were unavailable at the required time.\n\n4.

The sponsor must be able to provide a formal letter of confirmation from the production’s principal financier.\n\n6.

The sponsor must give prior notice to Equity providing supporting evidence detailing: description of the role and film, and the reasons why advertising was not appropriate and a letter in support. The sponsor must provide Equity with:\n\n• the details of the performer(s)required, role, description of the production; and\n\n• the reasons why the role has not been advertised; and,\n\n• a formal letter in support of the applicant from a financier or distributor; and\n\n• if the performer is an up-and-coming performer, or cast to appeal to a particular overseas audience, then evidence of their CV, reviews, previous work, awards/accolades, and/or evidence of audience appeal would be required.\n\n7. International Co-productions\n\nSponsors issuing CoSs to performers taking part in international co-productions structured under one of the UK’s bilateral co- production treaties, or under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production, need to provide the following evidence:\n\n• Provisional approval from the UK Film Council certification department that the film is being structured as an official co- production; or\n\n• Interim certification from the UK Film Council Certification Department.\nRequired advertising media for other posts A resident labour search in accordance with standard industry practice, which will normally involve engagement of casting agents within the EEA and contacting performers’ agents, and may include advertising on Equity’s job information service\nAdditional evidence required for stunt performers The sponsor must also demonstrate that the applicant possesses the equivalent qualifications, skills and competence to UK industry standards.

The Sponsor must be able to provide proof:\n\n• that the role requires certain highly specialist attributes; and\n\n• that the performer possesses those attributes; and\n\n• of the casting process and casting considerations; and\n\n• of reasonable and appropriate searches in the UK (if applicable); and\n\n• a list of any UK candidates who were unavailable at the required time.\n\n4.

The sponsor must provide Equity with:\n\n• the details of the performer(s)required, role, description of the production; and\n\n• the reasons why the role has not been advertised; and,\n\n• a formal letter in support of the applicant from a financier or distributor; and\n\n• if the performer is an up-and-coming performer, or cast to appeal to a particular overseas audience, then evidence of their CV, reviews, previous work, awards/accolades, and/or evidence of audience appeal would be required.\n\n7.
