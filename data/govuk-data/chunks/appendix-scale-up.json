Salary does not include other pay and benefits, such as any of the following: \n    1.   (a) pay which cannot be guaranteed because the nature of the job means that hours fluctuate; or\n    2.

If the applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, subject to SCU 7.4A, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week will be considered towards the salary requirements set out in SCU 7.1 (a).\n\nFor example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £15 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £37,440 (£15 x 48 x 52) per year and not £46,800 (£15 x 60 x 52).\n\n1.   SCU 7.4A. If the applicant is being sponsored to work a pattern where the regular hours are not the same each week, resulting in uneven pay: \n    1.   (a) work in excess of 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary threshold of £39,100, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week; and\n    2.   (b) any unpaid rest weeks will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met; and\n    3.   (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. in Part Suitability of these rules.\n\n2.   For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £15 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of just £31,200 (£15 x 40 x 52) per year.\n\n1.

The applicant must, during at least 50% of their most recent permission as a Scale-up Worker (for example, an applicant with 2 years’ permission as a Scale-up Worker must have had this level of earnings during at least 12 months of that permission), have had monthly PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least: \n    1.   (a) £39,100 per year; or\n    2.   (b) £36,300 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 4 April 2024 and 21 July 2025; or\n    3.   (c) £34,600 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 12 April 2023 and 3 April 2024; or\n    4.   (d) £33,000 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or before 11 April 2023.\n\n1.   SCU 8.2. For the purpose of meeting the requirement in SCU 8.1, periods of absence from work for any of the following reasons will be treated as periods during which the applicant was paid at the required level: \n    1.   (a) statutory maternity, paternity, parental, or shared parental leave; or\n    2.   (b) statutory adoption leave; or\n    3.   (c) sick leave\n\n2.   Providing at the time the absence starts the applicant’s job had PAYE earnings equivalent to at least: \n    1.   (i) £39,100 per year; or\n    2.   (ii) £36,300 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 4 April 2024 and 21 July 2025; or\n    3.   (iii) £34,600 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 12 April 2023 and 3 April 2024; or\n    4.   (iv) £33,000 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or before 11 April 2023.\n\n3.   For example, an applicant with 2 years’ permission, who spent 6 months on the above types of leave during a 2-year permission as a Scale-up Worker, must have had PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to the level stated in SCU 8.1. per year during at least 6 months of the remaining 18 months of that permission.\n\nSCU 8.3. PAYE means the guaranteed basic gross pay (before income tax and including employee pension and national insurance contributions), recorded through PAYE.\n\n1.   SCU 8.4. Earnings do not include other sources of income, such as any of the following: \n    1.   (a) earnings from self-employment; or\n    2.   (b) earnings from outside the UK; or\n    3.   (c) payments not recorded through PAYE; or\n    4.   (d) employer pension and employer national insurance contributions; or\n    5.   (e) income from savings, investments, property, inheritance, gambling or competitions.\n\nSCU 8.5. The decision maker must not have reasonable grounds to believe the PAYE earnings, or any part of the PAYE earnings, the applicant is relying on have been fabricated or inflated or do not relate to genuine employment.\n\n1.   SCU 8.6. To support the assessment in SCU 8.5, the decision maker may in particular consider any of the following: \n    1.   (a) whether the business from which the earnings are claimed can be shown to exist and be lawfully and genuinely trading; and\n    2.

(b) £36,300 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 4 April 2024 and 21 July 2025; or\n    3.   (c) £34,600 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 12 April 2023 and 3 April 2024; or\n    4.   (d) £33,000 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or before 11 April 2023.\n\n1.   SCU 18.2. The applicant must, during at least 24 months of the three years immediately before the date of application, have had monthly PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least: \n    1.   (a) £39,100 per year; or\n    2.

(c) £34,600 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 12 April 2023 and 3 April 2024; or\n    4.   (d) £33,000 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or before 11 April 2023.\n\n1.   SCU 18.3. For the purpose of meeting the requirement in SCU 18.2, periods of absence from work, for any of the following reasons will be treated as periods during which the applicant was paid at the required level: \n    1.   (a) statutory maternity, paternity, parental, or shared parental leave; or\n    2.   (b) statutory adoption leave; or\n    3.   (c) sick leave.\n\n2.   Providing at the time the absence starts the applicant’s job had PAYE earnings equivalent to: \n    1.   (i) £39,100 per year; or\n    2.   (ii) £36,300 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 4 April 2024 and 21 July 2025; or\n    3.   (iii) £34,600 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned between 12 April 2023 and 3 April 2024; or\n    4.   (iv) £33,000 per year if their most recent permission on the route was on the basis of a Certificate of Sponsorship assigned on or before 11 April 2023.\n\n3.   For example, an applicant, who spent 6 months on the above types of leave during their last 3-year’s permission as a Scale-up Worker, must have had monthly PAYE earnings in the UK equivalent to at least £39,100 per year during at least 18 months of the remaining 30 months of that permission.\n\nSCU 18.4. Earnings only include guaranteed basic gross pay (before income tax and including employee pension and national insurance contributions), recorded through PAYE.\n\n1.   SCU 18.5. Earnings do not include other sources of income, such as any of the following: \n    1.   (a) earnings from self-employment; or\n    2.   (b) earnings from outside the UK; or\n    3.   (c) payments not recorded through PAYE; or\n    4.   (d) employer pension and employer national insurance contributions; or\n    5.   (e) income from savings, investments, property, inheritance, gambling or competitions.\n\nSCU 18.6. The decision maker must not have reasonable grounds to believe the PAYE earnings the applicant is relying on have been inflated or fabricated or do not relate to genuine employment.\n\n1.   SCU 18.7. To support the assessment in SCU 18.6, the decision maker may in particular consider any of the following: \n    1.   (a) whether the business from which the earnings are claimed can be shown to exist and be lawfully and genuinely trading; and\n    2.
