Where the applicant is applying for settlement and their previous permission was as an Innovator Founder, they must provide an endorsement letter issued by an Endorsing Body, or Legacy Endorsing Body which includes all of the following information: \n    1.   (a) confirmation that the applicant has shown significant achievements, judged against the business plan assessed in their previous endorsement; and\n    2.   (b) confirmation that the applicant’s business is registered with Companies House and the applicant is listed as a director or member of that business; and\n    3.   (c) confirmation the business is active and trading; and\n    4.   (d) confirmation that the business appears to be sustainable for at least the following 12 months, based on its assets and expected income, weighed against its current and planned expenses; and\n    5.   (e) confirmation the applicant has demonstrated an active key role in the day-to-day management and development of the business; and\n    6.   (f) confirmation the applicant’s business venture has met at least two of the following requirements: \n        1.   (i) at least £50,000 has been invested into the business and actively spent furthering the business; or\n        2.   (ii) the number of the business’s customers has at least doubled within the most recent 3 years and is currently higher than the mean number of customers for other UK businesses offering comparable main products or services; or\n        3.   (iii) the business has engaged in significant research and development activity and has applied for intellectual property protection in the UK; or\n        4.   (iv) the business has generated a minimum annual gross revenue of £1million in the last full year covered by its accounts; or\n        5.   (v) the business is generating a minimum annual gross revenue of £500,000 in the last full year covered by its accounts, with at least £100,000 from exporting overseas; or\n        6.   (vi) the business has created the equivalent of at least 10 full-time jobs for settled workers; or\n        7.   (vii) the business has created the equivalent of at least 5 full-time jobs for settled workers, each of which has a mean salary of at least £25,000 a year (gross pay, excluding any allowances).\n\nINNF 17.2. An applicant cannot meet the requirements at INNF 17.1 by relying on the same criterion twice (for example, an applicant who has invested £100,000 (2 x £50,000) in their business venture, or who has applied for intellectual property protection in respect of more than one innovation, will be considered to have met one criterion, not two).\n\nINNF 17.3. If the business venture has one or more other team members who are applying for, or have been granted, settlement as an Innovator Founder, they cannot share the same means of meeting these criteria (for example, if two applicants are relying on the requirement to have created 10 jobs, 20 jobs must have been created in total).\n\n1.   INNF 17.4. If the applicant is relying on the criteria for creating jobs in INNF 17.1 (vi) or (vii), the following requirements must be met: \n    1.   (a) each job must have existed for at least 12 months and comply with all relevant UK legislation, including (but not limited to) the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 and the Working Time Regulations 1998; and\n    2.   (b) each job must involve an average of at least 30 hours of paid work per week, but two or more part time jobs held by different employees that when combined add up to 30 hours per week will represent the equivalent of a single full-time job, as long as each of the jobs has existed for at least 12 months; and\n    3.   (c) a job will be considered one for a settled worker if the worker met the definition of settled worker in the rules in force at the time they started the job, and they remained employed for the whole claimed 12-month period, even if they ceased to be a settled worker at a later date.\n\nINNF 17.5. A letter of endorsement from a Legacy Endorsing Body will only be accepted if the Legacy Endorsing Body supporting the current application is the same as the Endorsing Body that supported the applicant’s last grant of permission."
