If the decision maker is satisfied all the suitability and eligibility requirements for settlement are met the applicant will be granted settlement.\n\n1.   HK 64.1A. If the requirements for settlement are not met, but the decision maker believes the applicant is likely to meet all the suitability and eligibility requirements for permission to stay under Appendix Hong Kong BN(O) (based on the route under which they have or last had permission), the application will be varied by the Secretary of State to an application for permission to stay on that route. Where this happens: \n    1.   (a) no additional application fee for permission to stay will be required and the settlement application fee will not be refunded; and\n    2.   (b) the Secretary of State will write to the applicant informing them of this variation and if required will request the applicant pay any Immigration Health Charge.\n\nHK 64.1B If the applicant does not pay the requested Immigration Health Charge, the application for permission to stay will be rejected as invalid.\n\n1.   HK 64.1C. Where an applicant is granted permission to stay it will be granted for 30 months and subject to the following conditions: \n    1.   (a) no access to public funds; and\n    2.   (b) work (including self-employment and voluntary work) permitted except for employment as a professional sportsperson (including as a sports coach); and\n    3.   (c) study is permitted, subject to the ATAS condition in Appendix ATAS.\n    4.   (d) DELETED.\n\nHK 64.1D. If the decision maker is not satisfied that the applicant meets all the suitability and eligibility requirements for settlement or permission to stay, the application for settlement will be refused.\n\nHK 64.2. If the application is refused, a request can be made for an Administrative Review under Appendix AR: Administrative Review."

      "text": "### Variation of no access to public funds condition\n\n1.   HK 65.1 A person in the UK with permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route may have that permission varied to remove a no access to public funds condition where the decision maker is satisfied that: \n    1.   (a) the applicant is destitute, as defined in section 95 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, or is at risk of imminent destitution; or\n    2.   (b) there are reasons relating to the welfare of a relevant child which outweigh the considerations for maintaining the condition (treating the best interests of a relevant child as a primary consideration); or\n    3.   (c) the applicant is facing exceptional circumstances affecting their income or expenditure.\n\n1.   HK 65.2. For the purposes of HK 65.1, ‘relevant child’ means a person who: \n    1.   (i) is under the age of 18 years at the date of application; and\n    2.   (ii) it is clear from the information provided by the applicant, is a child who would be affected by a decision to impose or maintain the no access to public funds condition.\n\nHK 65.3. Where an applicant is applying for further permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route for 30 months and has previously had their permission varied to remove a no access to public funds condition under HK65.1, the decision maker may grant further permission without such a condition where they are satisfied that the applicant continues to meet the requirements set out in HK 65.1.\n\nPrint this page"
