(j) The Secretary of State may decide not to carry out the assessment in (f) if the application already falls for refusal on other grounds, but reserves the right to carry out this assessment in any reconsideration of the decision.\n11.   (k) The applicant must, unless he provides a reasonable explanation, comply with any request made by the Secretary of State to attend for interview.\n12.   (l) The application for indefinite leave to remain must have been made: \n    1.

(i) notwithstanding that the applicant has provided the relevant specified documents required under Appendix A or (where relevant) was awarded points in a previous application as a Tier 1 (Investor) Migrant, the applicant is or was not in control of and at liberty to freely invest the money specified in their application for the purposes of meeting the requirements of Appendix A to these Rules; or\n    2.

(2) where any of the specified money has been made available to the applicant by another party, that party, has been acquired by means of conduct which is unlawful in the UK, or would constitute unlawful conduct if it occurred in the UK, or has been or will be transferred internationally by means which are unlawful in any of the countries involved; or\n\n    3.   (iii) where any of the money specified in the application for the purposes of meeting the requirements of Appendix A to these Rules has been made available by another party, the character, conduct or associations of that party are such that approval of the application would not be conducive to the public good,\n    4.   and where the Entry Clearance Officer does have reasonable grounds to believe one or more of the above applies, no points from Appendix A will be awarded.\n\n7.

(g) If the applicant has failed to provide a criminal record certificate or an explanation in accordance with sub-paragraph (f), the decision maker may contact the applicant or his representative in writing, and request the certificate(s) or explanation. The requested certificate(s) or explanation must be received at the address specified in the request within 28 calendar days of the date of the request.\n9.
