(ii) a non-visa national (not a British or Irish national) who is seeking entry for any purpose other than as a visitor seeking entry for 6 months or less, or\n    3.   (iii) a British national without the right of abode who is seeking entry for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is required under these Rules.\n\nAny other person who wishes to ascertain in advance whether they are eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the issue of an entry clearance.\n\n1.   24A. A person who requires entry clearance must on arrival in the UK either: \n    1.   (i) produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry clearance, issued to them for the purpose for which they seek entry, which is still in force, or:\n    2.   (ii) where they have been granted a United Kingdom entry clearance which was issued to them in electronic form (an eVisa) for the purpose for which they seek entry and which is still in force, produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document.\n\n24B. A person who requires entry clearance and fails to meet the requirements of 24A must not be granted leave to enter on arrival.\n\n1.   25. Entry clearance takes the form of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals). A visa or an entry certificate may be issued in electronic form. These documents are to be taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility for entry into the United Kingdom, and accordingly accepted as “entry clearances” within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.\n2.   25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 will have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom. The requirements are that the entry clearance must specify the purpose for which the holder wishes to enter the United Kingdom and should be endorsed with the conditions to which it is subject or wish a statement that it has effect as indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom. The holder of such an entry clearance will not require leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom and, for the purposes of these Rules, will be treated as a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter the United Kingdom which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival.\n3.   26. An application for entry clearance will be considered in accordance with the provisions in these Rules governing the grant or refusal of leave to enter. Where appropriate, the term “Entry Clearance Officer” should be substituted for “Immigration Officer”.\n4.   27. An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of the decision, except that an applicant will not be refused an entry clearance where entry is sought in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 _or paragraph EC-C of Appendix FM_ solely on account of his attaining the age of 18 years between receipt of his application and the date of the decision on it.\n\n5.   28. An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom and Islands at the time of the application. An application for an entry clearance as a visitor or as a short-term student or under Appendix Ukraine Scheme must be made to any post designated by the Secretary of State to accept such applications. Subject to paragraph 28A, any other application must be made to a post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant.

They must obtain entry clearance (visa or entry certificate) before travel and produce valid documentation upon arrival; failure to do so results in refusal. Critical conditions include holding a valid, in-force clearance endorsed on a passport or electronic form.\n\n### Entry clearance\n\n1.   24. The following persons are required to obtain entry clearance in advance of travel to the UK: \n    1.   (i) a visa national;\n    2.   (ii) a non-visa national (not a British or Irish national) who is seeking entry for any purpose other than as a visitor seeking entry for 6 months or less, or\n    3.   (iii) a British national without the right of abode who is seeking entry for a purpose for which prior entry clearance is required under these Rules.\n\nAny other person who wishes to ascertain in advance whether they are eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the issue of an entry clearance.\n\n1.   24A. A person who requires entry clearance must on arrival in the UK either: \n    1.   (i) produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document endorsed with a United Kingdom entry clearance, issued to them for the purpose for which they seek entry, which is still in force, or:\n    2.   (ii) where they have been granted a United Kingdom entry clearance which was issued to them in electronic form (an eVisa) for the purpose for which they seek entry and which is still in force, produce to the Immigration Officer a valid passport or other identity document.\n\n24B. A person who requires entry clearance and fails to meet the requirements of 24A must not be granted leave to enter on arrival.\n\n1.   25. Entry clearance takes the form of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals). A visa or an entry certificate may be issued in electronic form. These documents are to be taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility for entry into the United Kingdom, and accordingly accepted as “entry clearances” within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.\n2.   25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 will have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom. The requirements are that the entry clearance must specify the purpose for which the holder wishes to enter the United Kingdom and should be endorsed with the conditions to which it is subject or wish a statement that it has effect as indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom. The holder of such an entry clearance will not require leave to enter on arrival in the United Kingdom and, for the purposes of these Rules, will be treated as a person who has arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to enter the United Kingdom which is in force but which was given to him before his arrival.\n3.   26. An application for entry clearance will be considered in accordance with the provisions in these Rules governing the grant or refusal of leave to enter. Where appropriate, the term “Entry Clearance Officer” should be substituted for “Immigration Officer”.\n4.   27. An application for entry clearance is to be decided in the light of the circumstances existing at the time of the decision, except that an applicant will not be refused an entry clearance where entry is sought in one of the categories contained in paragraphs 296-316 _or paragraph EC-C of Appendix FM_ solely on account of his attaining the age of 18 years between receipt of his application and the date of the decision on it.\n\n5.   28. An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom and Islands at the time of the application. An application for an entry clearance as a visitor or as a short-term student or under Appendix Ukraine Scheme must be made to any post designated by the Secretary of State to accept such applications. Subject to paragraph 28A, any other application must be made to a post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he is living.\n\n6.   28A (a) An application for entry clearance under Appendix Temporary Work-Creative Worker or Appendix International Sportsperson, where the applicant is applying for a period of permission of 12 months or less, may also be made at the post in the country or territory where the applicant is situated at the date of application, provided that: \n    1.

(ii) the applicant is in that country or territory for a similar purpose to the activity they propose to undertake in the UK; and\n    3.   (iii) the applicant is able to demonstrate to the Entry Clearance Officer that they have been given permission to live in that country or territory in accordance with its immigration laws.\n    4.   (b) An application for entry clearance under Appendix Global Talent or Appendix Youth Mobility Scheme may be made at the post in the country or territory where the applicant is situated at the date of application, provided that: \n        1.
