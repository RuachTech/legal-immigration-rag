This table relates to points options A-E set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 1 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant\u2019s sponsor. Options A to E refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   \u2022 the rate shown by the median ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   \u2022 \u00a317.13 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where \u00a317.13 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, \u00a317.13 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\n| SOC 2020

      "text": "### Table 2: Eligible SOC 2020 occupation codes and related going rates based on 25th percentile Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data\n\nThese SOC 2020 occupation codes are considered to be skilled to Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 6 or above, and are eligible for the Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility and Scale-up routes. This table relates to points options F-J set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\nGoing rates in Table 2 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant\u2019s sponsor. Options F to J refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.\n\n1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: \n    1.   \u2022 the rate shown by the 25th percentile ASHE data for that occupation; or\n    2.   \u2022 \u00a312.82 per hour\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, where \u00a312.82 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, \u00a312.82 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.\n\nOnly the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.\n\nEquivalent SOC 2010 occupation codes are included where they were previously eligible for the Skilled Worker route, for ease of matching to the relevant SOC 2020 occupation codes for applicants being sponsored to continue working in the same occupation.\n\n| SOC 2020 occupation code | Equivalent SOC 2010 occupation code(s) | Examples of related job titles (non-exclusive) | Going rate (SW \u2013 options F and I, GBM and SCU) | 90% of going rate (SW \u2013 option G) | 80% of going rate (SW \u2013 option H) | 70% of going rate (SW \u2013 option J, GTR) | Eligible for PhD points

before 4 April 2030, the applicant was granted permission as a lead applicant on a Global Business Mobility route under the Rules in place before 4 April 2024, and they have had continuous permission as a lead applicant on the Global Business Mobility route since then.\n\nOther than skill level, the notes accompanying Table 2 also apply to this table, except that equivalent SOC 2010 occupation
