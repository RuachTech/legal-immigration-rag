The sponsor must be able to supply proof that the requirement is met, e.g. contract of employment.\n\n4.

This is in order to verify that the applicant is being genuinely engaged for reasons of continuity. Sponsors may issue Certificates of Sponsorship for performers to enter the UK to undertake post-production work only and provided that such post- production work solely relates to their own role in the film or TV production. For such Certificate of Sponsorship, neither the one month requirement nor prior notice to Equity procedure applies.\nThe Sponsor must be able to supply documentary proof that the performer has worked on, or will be working on, the same production outside the UK for at least a month e.g. contracts, press cuttings, cast lists, etc\n\n2.The performer has international status\n\nThe sponsor must be able to provide proof the applicant is known internationally, or they have demonstrable international box-office appeal e.g. press cuttings, awards, accolades, publicity material, television/radio interviews, film and TV credits; or documentary proof that the performer has demonstrable international box-office appeal through international box office figures for films they have starred in or led as a principal performer.\n\n3.

The sponsor must be able to provide:\n\n\u2022 A formal letter from the broadcaster or producer or copy of the relevant section of the commissioning agreement confirming the reason the migrant is required (e.g. to feature in an entertainment programme); and\n\n\u2022 The name of the programme concerned; and\n\n\u2022 Details of any recording or filming schedules.\n\n5.

The sponsor must give prior notice to Equity providing supporting evidence detailing: description of the role and film, and the reasons why advertising was not appropriate and a letter in support. The sponsor must provide Equity with:\n\n\u2022 the details of the performer(s)required, role, description of the production; and\n\n\u2022 the reasons why the role has not been advertised; and,\n\n\u2022 a formal letter in support of the applicant from a financier or distributor; and\n\n\u2022 if the performer is an up-and-coming performer, or cast to appeal to a particular overseas audience, then evidence of their CV, reviews, previous work, awards/accolades, and/or evidence of audience appeal would be required.\n\n7. International Co-productions\n\nSponsors issuing CoSs to performers taking part in international co-productions structured under one of the UK\u2019s bilateral co- production treaties, or under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production, need to provide the following evidence:\n\n\u2022 Provisional approval from the UK Film Council certification department that the film is being structured as an official co- production; or\n\n\u2022 Interim certification from the UK Film Council Certification Department.\nRequired advertising media for other posts A resident labour search in accordance with standard industry practice, which will normally involve engagement of casting agents within the EEA and contacting performers\u2019 agents, and may include advertising on Equity\u2019s job information service\nAdditional evidence required for stunt performers The sponsor must also demonstrate that the applicant possesses the equivalent qualifications, skills and competence to UK industry standards.

Other forms of advertising may be appropriate depending on the type of role. For longer terms contracts, advertisements in Guardian Media, Broadcast, Screen International, Marketing Week would be appropriate.\n\nUnder this category, in the case of camera, editing and grip grades, and 1st Assistant Directors, the Home Office shall promptly notify BECTU of the issuing of certificates of sponsorship and BECTU may request sight of the evidence of the steps to search for resident labour for these roles.\n\nUnder this category, in the case of Executive Producer (when providing the functions of a Line Producer or Financial Controller/Production Accountant) Line Producer, Co-Producer, 1st Assistant Director, Unit Production Manager, Production Supervisor, Financial Controller, Production Accountant grades, the Home Office will promptly notify the Production Guild of the issuing of a certificate of sponsorship and the Production Guild may request sight of the evidence in support for such roles.\nAdditional evidence required for Personal Assistants to Directors and Producers of international status Sponsors may issue a Certificate of Sponsorship to a single, non-technical, non-creative personal assistant who supports a Director or Producer under category 1, who has demonstrable international status i.e. are known worldwide for international box office success.\nThe Sponsor must notify BECTU promptly of the issuing of a certificate under this category for a PA to a Director and must notify the Production Guild promptly of the issuing of a certificate for a PA to a Producer.
