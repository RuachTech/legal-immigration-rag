(i) A letter from the employer confirming the employment, the gross annual salary and the annual salary after income tax and National Insurance contributions have been paid, how long the employment has been held, and the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or agency).\n        2.   (ii) Payslips covering the period of 6 months prior to the date of application or such shorter period as the current employment has been held.\n        3.   (iii) personal bank statement covering the same period as the payslips, showing that the salary has been paid into an account in the name of the person or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.\n\n    2.

(c) Where self-employment in the UK of the applicant or their partner, parent, parent\u2019s partner or sponsor, or income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies, is relied upon, paragraph 7 or 9 applies as appropriate.\n    4.   (d) Where the non-employment income of the applicant or their partner, parent, parent\u2019s partner or sponsor is relied upon, paragraph 10 applies and paragraph 10(f) shall apply as if it referred to any UK welfare benefit or tax credit relied upon and to HMRC as well as Department for Work and Pensions or other official documentation.\n    5.   (e) Where the cash savings of the applicant or their partner, parent, parent\u2019s partner or sponsor are relied upon, paragraphs 11 and 11A apply.\n    6.

(a) Establish the total cash savings which meet the requirements of paragraphs 11 and 11A;\n    2.   (b) Divide this figure by the number of weeks of limited leave which would be issued if the application were granted, or by 52 if the application is for indefinite leave to enter or remain;\n    3.   (c) Add the figure in sub-paragraph 12B(b) to the weekly net income (before the deduction of housing costs) available to meet the requirement.",

      "text": "### Calculating Gross Annual Income under Appendix FM\n\n1.   13. Based on evidence that meets the requirements of this Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to the applicable provisions of Appendix FM, gross annual income under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.7., E-ECC.2.1., E-ECC.2.5., E-LTRC.2.1. and E-LTRC.2.5. will, subject to paragraph 21A of this Appendix, be calculated in the following ways: \n    1.   (a) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application, has been employed by their current employer for at least 6 months and has been paid throughout the period of 6 months prior to the date of application at a level of gross annual salary which equals or exceeds the level relied upon in paragraph 13(a)(i), their gross annual income will be (where paragraph 13(b) does not apply) the total of: \n        1.   (i) The level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        3.   (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner.\n\n    2.   (b) Where the person is in salaried employment in the UK at the date of application and has been employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph 13(a)), their gross annual income will be the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        3.   (iii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner. In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.\n\n    3.   (c) Where the person is the applicant\u2019s partner, is in salaried employment outside of the UK at the date of application, has been employed by their current employer for at least 6 months, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person\u2019s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a); and also\n        2.   (ii) On that basis but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning.\n\n    4.   (d) Where the person is the applicant\u2019s partner, has been in salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months of the date of application, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person\u2019s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a) but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning; and also\n        2.   (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 15(b).\n\n    5.   (e) Where the person is self-employed, their gross annual income will be the total of their gross income from their self-employment (and that of their partner if that person is in the UK with permission to work), from any salaried or non-salaried employment they have had or their partner has had (if their partner is in the UK with permission to work), from specified non-employment income received by them or their partner, and from income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner, in the last full financial year or as an average of the last two full financial years. The requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to these forms of income shall apply as if references to the date of application were references to the end of the relevant financial year(s). The relevant financial year(s) cannot be combined with any financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 applies and vice versa.\n    6.   (f) Where the person is self-employed, they cannot combine their gross annual income at paragraph 13(e) with specified savings in order to meet the level of income required under Appendix FM.\n    7.   (g) Where the person is not relying on income from salaried employment or self-employment, their gross annual income will be the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by them or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        2.   (ii) The gross annual income from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension received by them or their partner.\n\n    8.   (h) Where the person is the applicant\u2019s partner and is in self-employment outside the UK at the date of application and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person\u2019s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.   (i) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a) but substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning; and also\n        2.   (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(e).\n\n    9.   (i) Any period of unpaid maternity, paternity, adoption, parental or sick leave in the 12 months prior to the date of application will not be counted towards any period relating to employment, or any period relating to income from employment, for which this Appendix provides.\n    10.   (j) The provisions of paragraph 13 which apply to self-employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies and to a person in receipt of such income.\n    11.   (k) Where the application relies on the employment income of the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must be calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or under sub-paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15, and not under a combination of these methods.\n\n2.   14. Where the requirements of this Appendix and Appendix FM are met by the combined income or cash savings of more than one person, the income or the cash savings must only be counted once unless stated otherwise.\n3.   15. In respect of paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 13(d), the provisions in this paragraph also apply: \n    1.   (a) In order to evidence the level of gross annual income required by Appendix FM, the person must meet the requirements in paragraph 13(b) or paragraph 13(d)(i); and\n    2.   (b) The person must also meet the level of gross annual income required by Appendix FM on the basis that their income is the total of: \n        1.   (i) The gross income from salaried employment in the UK or overseas earned by the person in the 12 months prior to the date of application;\n        2.   (ii) The gross amount of any specified non-employment income (other than pension income) received by the person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application;\n        3.   (iii) The gross amount received from a UK or foreign State pension or a private pension by the person or their partner in the 12 months prior to the date of application; and\n        4.   (iv)The person cannot combine the gross annual income at paragraph 15(b)(i)-(iii) with specified savings in order to meet the level of income required.\n\n4.   16. Where a person is in receipt of maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or has been so in the 6 months prior to the date of application, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) the relevant date for considering the length of employment with their current employer will be the date that the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick leave commenced or the date of application; and\n    2.   (b) the relevant period for calculating income from their salaried employment will be the period prior to the commencement of the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or to the date of application.\n\n5.   17. If a person is an equity partner, for example in a law firm, the income they draw from the partnership (including where this is in the form of a profit share) will be treated as salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM.\n6.   17A. Where a person is a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme administered by HMRC and does not rely on paragraph 13(e), the income they receive as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme may be treated as income from salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM. In that case, the requirements for specified evidence in paragraph 2 must be met, subject to applying those requirements so as to reflect the person\u2019s status as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme.\n7.   18. When calculating income from salaried employment under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 16, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Basic pay, skills-based allowances, and UK location-based allowances will be counted as income provided that: \n        1.   (i) They are contractual; and\n        2.   (ii) Where these allowances make up more than 30% of the total salary, only the amount up to 30% is counted.\n\n    2.   (b) Overtime, payments to cover travel time, commission-based pay and bonuses (which can include tips and gratuities paid via a tronc scheme registered with HMRC) will be counted as income, where they have been received in the relevant period(s) of employment or self-employment relied upon in the application.\n    3.   (bb) In respect of a person in salaried employment at the date of application, the amount of income in sub-paragraph (b) which may be added to their gross annual salary, and counted as part of that figure for the purposes of paragraph 13(a)(i) or 13(b)(i), is the annual equivalent of the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from that income in their current employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application.\n    4.   (c) Payments relating to the costs of UK or overseas travel, including (for example) travelling or relocation expenses and subsistence or accommodation allowances, and payments made towards the costs of living overseas, will not be counted as income.\n    5.   (d) Gross income from non-salaried employment will be calculated on the same basis as income from salaried employment, except as provided in paragraph 18(e) and 18(f), and the requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to salaried employment shall apply as if references to salary were references to income from non-salaried employment. Non-salaried employment includes that paid at an hourly or other rate (and the number and/or pattern of hours required to be worked may vary), or paid an amount which varies according to the work undertaken, whereas salaried employment includes that paid at a minimum fixed rate (usually annual) and is subject usually to a contractual minimum number of hours to be worked.\n    6.   (e) For the purpose of paragraph 13(a)(i), in respect of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application \u201cthe level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application\u201d shall be no greater than the annual equivalent of the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application, where that employment was held throughout that period.\n    7.   (f) For the purpose of paragraph 13(b)(i), \u201cthe gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application\u201d of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application shall be considered to be the annual equivalent of: \n        1.   (aa) the person\u2019s gross income from non-salaried employment in the period immediately prior to the date of application, where the employment has been held for a period of no more than one month at the date of application; or\n        2.   (bb) the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment, where the employment has been held for a period of more than one month at the date of application.\n\n    8.   (g) For the purpose of paragraphs 13(c)(ii) and 13(d)(i), \u201cthe gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning\u201d of a person who is returning to the UK to take up non-salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return is the gross annual income from that employment, based on the rate or amount of pay, and the standard or core hours of work, set out in the document(s) from the employer provided under paragraph 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 18(b), this may include the gross \u201con-target\u201d earnings which may be expected from satisfactory performance in the standard or core hours of work.\n\n8.   19. When calculating income from self-employment under paragraphs 12A and 13(e), and in relation to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) There must be evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of application.\n    2.   (b) Where the self-employed person is a sole trader or is in a partnership or franchise agreement, the income will be the gross taxable profits from their share of the business in the relevant financial year(s), not including any deductable allowances, expenses or liabilities which may be applied to the gross taxable profits to establish the final tax liability.\n    3.   (c) Where income to which paragraph 19 applies is being used to meet the financial requirement for an initial application for leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM by an applicant who used such income to meet that requirement in an application for entry clearance as a fianc\u00e9(e) or proposed civil partner under that Appendix in the last 12 months, the Secretary of State may continue to accept the same level and evidence of income to which paragraph 19 applies that was accepted in granting the application for entry clearance, provided that there is evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of the application for leave to remain.\n    4.   (d) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 7 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Statement(s) of Account (SA300 or SA302) relates.\n    5.   (e) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Company Tax Return(s) CT600 relates.\n\n9.   20. When calculating income from specified non-employment sources under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 15, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Assets or savings must be in the name of the person, or jointly with their partner.\n    2.   (b) Any asset or savings on which income is based must be held or owned by the person at the date of application.\n    3.   (c) Any rental income from property, in the UK or overseas, must be from a property that is: \n        1.   (i) owned by the person;\n        2.   (ii) not their main residence and will not be so if the application is granted, except in the circumstances specified in paragraph 20(e); and\n        3.   (iii) if ownership of the property is shared with a third party, only income received from their share of the property can be counted.\n\n    4.   (cc) The amount of rental income from property received before any management fee was deducted may be counted.\n    5.   (d) Equity in a property cannot be used to meet the financial requirement.\n    6.   (e) Where the applicant and their partner are resident outside the UK at the date of application, rental income from a property in the UK that will become their main residence if the application is granted may only be counted under paragraph 13(c)(i) and paragraph 13(d)(ii).\n    7.   (f) Any future entitlement to a maintenance grant or stipend of the type specified in paragraph 10(g) may be counted as though the person had received the annual amount of that grant or stipend in the 12 months prior to the date of application.\n\n10.   20A. When calculating the gross annual income from pension under paragraph 13, the gross annual amount of any pension received may be counted where the pension has become a source of income at least 28 days prior to the date of application.\n11.   21. When calculating income under paragraphs 13 to 16, the following sources will not be counted: \n    1.   (a) Loans and credit facilities.\n    2.   (b) Income-related benefits: Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Support (or any equivalent) and income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance.\n    3.   (c) The following contributory benefits: contribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit.\n    4.

(d) Where the person is the applicant\u2019s partner, has been in salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months of the date of application, and is returning to the UK to take up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return, the person\u2019s gross annual income will be calculated: \n        1.

(j) The provisions of paragraph 13 which apply to self-employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies and to a person in receipt of such income.\n    11.   (k) Where the application relies on the employment income of the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must be calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or under sub-paragraph 13(b) and paragraph 15, and not under a combination of these methods.\n\n2.   14. Where the requirements of this Appendix and Appendix FM are met by the combined income or cash savings of more than one person, the income or the cash savings must only be counted once unless stated otherwise.\n3.   15.

Where a person is in receipt of maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or has been so in the 6 months prior to the date of application, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) the relevant date for considering the length of employment with their current employer will be the date that the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick leave commenced or the date of application; and\n    2.   (b) the relevant period for calculating income from their salaried employment will be the period prior to the commencement of the maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay or to the date of application.\n\n5.   17. If a person is an equity partner, for example in a law firm, the income they draw from the partnership (including where this is in the form of a profit share) will be treated as salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM.\n6.   17A. Where a person is a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme administered by HMRC and does not rely on paragraph 13(e), the income they receive as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme may be treated as income from salaried employment for the purposes of this Appendix and Appendix FM. In that case, the requirements for specified evidence in paragraph 2 must be met, subject to applying those requirements so as to reflect the person\u2019s status as a subcontractor under the Construction Industry Scheme.\n7.   18. When calculating income from salaried employment under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 16, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Basic pay, skills-based allowances, and UK location-based allowances will be counted as income provided that: \n        1.   (i) They are contractual; and\n        2.

(bb) In respect of a person in salaried employment at the date of application, the amount of income in sub-paragraph (b) which may be added to their gross annual salary, and counted as part of that figure for the purposes of paragraph 13(a)(i) or 13(b)(i), is the annual equivalent of the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from that income in their current employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application.\n    4.   (c) Payments relating to the costs of UK or overseas travel, including (for example) travelling or relocation expenses and subsistence or accommodation allowances, and payments made towards the costs of living overseas, will not be counted as income.\n    5.   (d) Gross income from non-salaried employment will be calculated on the same basis as income from salaried employment, except as provided in paragraph 18(e) and 18(f), and the requirements of this Appendix for specified evidence relating to salaried employment shall apply as if references to salary were references to income from non-salaried employment. Non-salaried employment includes that paid at an hourly or other rate (and the number and/or pattern of hours required to be worked may vary), or paid an amount which varies according to the work undertaken, whereas salaried employment includes that paid at a minimum fixed rate (usually annual) and is subject usually to a contractual minimum number of hours to be worked.\n    6.   (e) For the purpose of paragraph 13(a)(i), in respect of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application \u201cthe level of gross annual salary relied upon in the application\u201d shall be no greater than the annual equivalent of the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment in the 6 months prior to the date of application, where that employment was held throughout that period.\n    7.   (f) For the purpose of paragraph 13(b)(i), \u201cthe gross annual salary from employment as it was at the date of application\u201d of a person in non-salaried employment at the date of application shall be considered to be the annual equivalent of: \n        1.   (aa) the person\u2019s gross income from non-salaried employment in the period immediately prior to the date of application, where the employment has been held for a period of no more than one month at the date of application; or\n        2.   (bb) the person\u2019s average gross monthly income from non-salaried employment, where the employment has been held for a period of more than one month at the date of application.\n\n    8.   (g) For the purpose of paragraphs 13(c)(ii) and 13(d)(i), \u201cthe gross annual salary in the salaried employment in the UK to which they are returning\u201d of a person who is returning to the UK to take up non-salaried employment in the UK starting within 3 months of their return is the gross annual income from that employment, based on the rate or amount of pay, and the standard or core hours of work, set out in the document(s) from the employer provided under paragraph 4. Notwithstanding paragraph 18(b), this may include the gross \u201con-target\u201d earnings which may be expected from satisfactory performance in the standard or core hours of work.\n\n8.   19. When calculating income from self-employment under paragraphs 12A and 13(e), and in relation to income from employment and/or shares in a limited company based in the UK of a type to which paragraph 9 applies, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) There must be evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of application.\n    2.   (b) Where the self-employed person is a sole trader or is in a partnership or franchise agreement, the income will be the gross taxable profits from their share of the business in the relevant financial year(s), not including any deductable allowances, expenses or liabilities which may be applied to the gross taxable profits to establish the final tax liability.\n    3.   (c) Where income to which paragraph 19 applies is being used to meet the financial requirement for an initial application for leave to remain as a partner under Appendix FM by an applicant who used such income to meet that requirement in an application for entry clearance as a fianc\u00e9(e) or proposed civil partner under that Appendix in the last 12 months, the Secretary of State may continue to accept the same level and evidence of income to which paragraph 19 applies that was accepted in granting the application for entry clearance, provided that there is evidence of ongoing self-employment, and (where income from salaried employment is also relied upon or where paragraph 9(c) applies) ongoing employment, at the date of the application for leave to remain.\n    4.   (d) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 7 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Statement(s) of Account (SA300 or SA302) relates.\n    5.   (e) The financial year(s) to which paragraph 9 refers is the period of the last full financial year(s) to which the required Company Tax Return(s) CT600 relates.\n\n9.   20. When calculating income from specified non-employment sources under paragraphs 12A and 13 to 15, this paragraph applies: \n    1.   (a) Assets or savings must be in the name of the person, or jointly with their partner.\n    2.   (b) Any asset or savings on which income is based must be held or owned by the person at the date of application.\n    3.   (c) Any rental income from property, in the UK or overseas, must be from a property that is: \n        1.   (i) owned by the person;\n        2.   (ii) not their main residence and will not be so if the application is granted, except in the circumstances specified in paragraph 20(e); and\n        3.   (iii) if ownership of the property is shared with a third party, only income received from their share of the property can be counted.\n\n    4.   (cc) The amount of rental income from property received before any management fee was deducted may be counted.\n    5.   (d) Equity in a property cannot be used to meet the financial requirement.\n    6.   (e) Where the applicant and their partner are resident outside the UK at the date of application, rental income from a property in the UK that will become their main residence if the application is granted may only be counted under paragraph 13(c)(i) and paragraph 13(d)(ii).\n    7.   (f) Any future entitlement to a maintenance grant or stipend of the type specified in paragraph 10(g) may be counted as though the person had received the annual amount of that grant or stipend in the 12 months prior to the date of application.\n\n10.   20A. When calculating the gross annual income from pension under paragraph 13, the gross annual amount of any pension received may be counted where the pension has become a source of income at least 28 days prior to the date of application.\n11.   21. When calculating income under paragraphs 13 to 16, the following sources will not be counted: \n    1.   (a) Loans and credit facilities.\n    2.   (b) Income-related benefits: Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Pension Credit, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit or Support (or any equivalent) and income-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance.\n    3.   (c) The following contributory benefits: contribution-based Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance, contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance and Incapacity Benefit.\n    4.   (cc) Unemployability Allowance, Allowance for a Lowered Standard of Occupation and Invalidity Allowance under the War Pension Scheme.\n    5.   (d) Child Benefit.\n    6.   (e) Working Tax Credit.\n    7.   (f) Child Tax Credit.\n    8.   (ff) Universal Credit.\n    9.   (g) Any other source of income not specified in this appendix.",

Where paragraph GEN.3.1.(1) of Appendix FM applies, the decision-maker is required to take into account the sources of income, financial support or funds specified in sub-paragraph (2).\n\n1.   (2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) to (8), the following sources of income, financial support or funds will be taken into account (in addition to those set out in, as appropriate, paragraph E-ECP.3.2., E-LTRP. 3.2., E-ECC.2.2. or E-LTRC.2.2. of Appendix FM): \n    1.   (a) a credible guarantee of sustainable financial support to the applicant or their partner from a third party;\n    2.   (b) credible prospective earnings from the sustainable employment or self-employment of the applicant or their partner; or\n    3.   (c) any other credible and reliable source of income or funds for the applicant or their partner, which is available to them at the date of application or which will become available to them during the period of limited leave applied for.\n\n2.   (3) Where the applicant is a child: \n    1.   (a) other references in this paragraph to \u201capplicant\u201d mean the \u201capplicant\u2019s parent\u201d under paragraph E-ECC.1.6. or E-LTRC.1.6. of Appendix FM; and\n    2.

(4) The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the decision-maker of the genuineness, credibility and reliability of the source of income, financial support or funds relied upon, on the basis of the information and evidence provided, having regard (in particular, but without limitation) to the factors set out below.\n4.   (5) The source of income, financial support or funds must not be a loan, unless evidence submitted with the application shows that: \n    1.   (a) the source is a mortgage on a residential or commercial property in the UK or overseas which at the date of application is owned by the applicant, their partner or both, or by the third party to whom sub-paragraph (2)(a) refers;\n    2.   (b) the mortgage is provided by a financial institution regulated by the appropriate regulatory body for the country in which that institution is operating; and\n    3.   (c) the mortgage payments are reasonably affordable by the person(s) responsible for them and are likely to remain so for the period of limited leave applied for.\n\n5.   (6) Any cash savings or any current financial investment or product relied upon by the applicant under sub-paragraph (2)(c) must at the date of application be in the name(s), and under the control, of the applicant, their partner or both.\n6.   (7) Any cash savings relied upon by the applicant must enable the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP.3.1.(b), E-LTRP.3.1.(b), E-LTRP.3.7.(b), E-ECC.2.1.(b), E-ECC.2.5.(b), E-LTRC.2.1.(b) or E-LTRC.2.5.(b) of Appendix FM (as applicable) to be met, except that the criteria in sub-paragraph (8)(c) apply in place of the requirements in paragraphs 11 and 11A of this Appendix.\n7.   (8) In determining the genuineness, credibility and reliability of the source of income, financial support or funds relied upon under sub-paragraph (2), the decision-maker will take into account all the information and evidence provided, and will consider (in particular): \n    1.   (a) in respect of a guarantee of sustainable financial support from a third party: \n        1.   (i) whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence from the third party in question of their guarantee of financial support;\n        2.   (ii) whether that evidence is signed, dated and witnessed or otherwise independently verified;\n        3.   (iii) whether the third party has provided sufficient evidence of their general financial situation to enable the decision-maker to assess the likelihood of the guaranteed financial support continuing for the period of limited leave applied for;\n        4.   (iv) whether the third party has provided verifiable documentary evidence of the nature, extent and duration of any current or previous financial support which they have provided to the applicant or their partner;\n        5.   (v) the extent to which this source of financial support is relied upon by the applicant to meet the financial requirement in paragraph E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.7., E-ECC.2.1., E-ECC.2.5., E-LTRC.2.1. or E-LTRC.2.5. of Appendix FM (as applicable); and\n        6.   (vi) the likelihood of a change in the third party\u2019s financial situation or in their relationship with the applicant or the applicant\u2019s partner during the period of limited leave applied for.\n\n    2.   (b) in respect of prospective earnings from sustainable employment or self-employment of the applicant or their partner: \n        1.   (i) whether, at the date of application, a specific offer of employment has been made, or a clear basis for self-employment exists. In either case, such employment or self-employment must be expected to commence within three months of the applicant\u2019s arrival in the UK (if the applicant is applying for entry clearance) or within three months of the date of application (if the applicant is applying for leave to remain);\n        2.   (ii) whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence of the offer of employment or the basis for self-employment, and, if so, whether that evidence: \n            1.

(bb) is signed, dated and witnessed or otherwise independently verified;\n            3.   (cc) includes (in respect of an offer of employment) a signed or draft contract of employment;\n            4.   (dd) includes (in respect of self-employment) any of a signed or draft contract for the provision of goods or services; a signed or draft partnership or franchise agreement; an application to the appropriate authority for a licence to trade; or details of the agreed or proposed purchase or rental of business premises;\n\n        3.   (iii) whether, in respect of an offer of employment in the UK, the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence: \n            1.   (aa) of a relevant employment advertisement and employment application;\n            2.   (bb) of the hours to be worked and the rate of gross pay, which that evidence must establish equals or exceeds the National Living Wage or the National Minimum Wage (as applicable, given the age of the person to be employed) and equals or exceeds the going rate for such work in that part of the UK; and\n            3.   (cc) which enables the decision-maker to assess the reliability of the offer of employment, including in light of the total size of the workforce and the turnover (annual gross income or sales) of the relevant company or other organisation;\n\n        4.   (iv) whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence that at the date of application, the person to be employed or self-employed is in, or has recently been in, sustained employment or self-employment of the same or a similar type, of the same or a similar level of complexity and at the same or a similar level of responsibility;\n        5.

(i) whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence of the source;\n        2.   (ii) whether that evidence is provided by a financial institution regulated by the appropriate regulatory body for the country in which that institution is operating, and is signed, dated and witnessed or otherwise independently verified;\n        3.   (iii) where the income is or the funds are based on, or derived from, ownership of an asset, whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary evidence of its current or previous ownership by the applicant, their partner or both;\n        4.   (iv) whether the applicant has provided sufficient evidence to enable the decision-maker to assess the likelihood of the source of income or funds being available to them during the period of limited leave applied for; and\n        5.

The evidence required of passing an English language test in speaking and listening (at a minimum of level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) with a provider approved by the Secretary of State, where the applicant relies on that pass to meet an English language requirement, is confirmation on the on-line verification system operated by an approved English language test provider and at an approved Secure English Language Test centre that: \n    1.   (i) the applicant has passed such a test; and\n    2.   (ii) that test was an English language test in speaking and listening which is approved by the Secretary of State and was taken no more than two years before the date of application and at a test centre approved by the Secretary of State as a Secure English Language Test Centre or if they have already shown they met the requirement in this manner at the level required for their current application, in a previous successful application for entry clearance or permission to stay.\n\n2.   28. The evidence required to show that a person is a citizen or national of a majority English speaking country is a valid passport or travel document, unless paragraphs 29 and 30 apply. A dual national may invoke either of their nationalities.\n3.   29. If the applicant has not provided their passport or travel document other evidence of nationality can be supplied in the following circumstances only (as indicated by the applicant on their application form): \n    1.   (a) where the passport or travel document has been lost or stolen;\n    2.   (b) where the passport or travel document has expired and been returned to the relevant authorities; or\n    3.   (c) where the passport or travel document is with another part of the Home Office.\n\n4.   30. Alternative evidence as proof of nationality, if acceptable, must be either: \n    1.   (a) A current national identity document; or\n    2.   (b) A letter from the applicant\u2019s national government, Embassy or High Commission confirming the applicant\u2019s full name, date of birth and nationality.\n\n5.   31. Evidence of an academic qualification under paragraphs 284(ix)(c), (d) and (e), 290 (viii) (c), (d) and (e) and 295D(xi)(c), (d) and (e) of Part 8 and paragraphs E-ECP.4.1.(c), E-LTRP.4.1.(c), E-LTRP.4.1A.(c), E-ECPT.4.1.(c), E-LTRPT.5.1.(c) and E-LTRPT.5.1A.(c) of Appendix FM must be: \n    1.   (a) a certificate issued by the relevant institution confirming the award of the academic qualification showing: \n        1.   (i) the applicant\u2019s name;\n        2.   (ii) the title of award;\n        3.   (iii)the date of award; and\n        4.   (iv)the name of the awarding institution; or\n\n    2.   (b) if the applicant is awaiting graduation or no longer has the certificate and cannot obtain a new one, either: \n        1.   (i) an academic reference from the institution awarding the academic qualification that: \n            1.   1) is on official letter headed paper;\n            2.   2) shows the applicant\u2019s name;\n            3.   3) shows the title of award;\n            4.   4) explains when the academic qualification has been, or will be, awarded; and\n            5.   5) confirms either the date that the certificate will be issued (if the applicant has not yet graduated) or that the institution is unable to re-issue the certificate of award; or\n\n        2.   (ii) an academic transcript that: \n            1.   (1) is on official letter headed paper;\n            2.   (2) shows the applicant\u2019s name;\n            3.   (3) shows the name of the academic institution;\n            4.   (4) shows the course title; and\n            5.   (5) confirms either the date that the certificate will be issued (if the applicant has not yet graduated) or that the institution is unable to re-issue the certificate of award; and\n\n    3.   (c) if the qualification was awarded by an educational establishment outside the UK, a document from Ecctis which confirms that the qualification meets or exceeds the recognised standard of a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree or PhD in the UK and was taught or researched in English to level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common Framework of Reference for Languages or above.\n\n6.   32. If the qualification was taken in one of the following countries, it will be assumed for the purpose of paragraph 31 that it was taught or researched in English: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Overseas Territories, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Ireland, Jamaica, New Zealand, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK, the USA, Malta.\n7.   32A. For the avoidance of doubt paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix apply to fianc\u00e9(e), proposed civil partner, spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner and same sex partner applications for limited leave to enter or remain made under Part 8 of these Rules where English language requirements apply, regardless of the date of application. Paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix also apply to spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner and same sex partner applications which do not meet the requirements of Part 8 of these Rules for indefinite leave to remain (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) and are being considered for a grant of limited leave to remain where paragraph A277A(b) of these Rules applies. Any references in paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix to \u201climited leave to enter or remain\u201d shall therefore be read as referring to all applicants referred to in this paragraph.\n8.   32B. Where the decision-maker has: \n    1.   (a) reasonable cause to doubt that an English language test in speaking and listening at a minimum of level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common Framework of Reference for Languages relied on at any time to meet a requirement for limited leave to enter or remain in Part 8 or Appendix FM was genuinely obtained; or\n    2.   (b) information that the test certificate or result awarded to the applicant has been withdrawn by the test provider for any reason,\n    3.   the decision-maker may discount the test certificate or result and require the applicant to provide a new test certificate or result from an approved provider which shows that they meet the requirement, if they are not exempt from it.\n\n9.   32C. If an applicant applying for limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 or Appendix FM submits an English language test certificate or result which has ceased by the date of application to be: \n    1.

(c) from an approved test centre, the decision-maker will not accept that certificate or result as valid, unless the decision-maker does so in accordance with paragraph 32D of this Appendix and subject to any transitional arrangements made in respect of the test provider, test or test centre in question.\n\n10.   32D. If an applicant applying for limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 or Appendix FM submits an English language test certificate or result and the Home Office has already accepted it as part of a successful previous application in any route (but not where the application was refused, even if on grounds other than the English language requirement), the decision-maker will accept that certificate or result as valid if it is: \n    1.   (a) from a provider which is no longer approved, or\n    2.   (b) from a provider who remains approved but the test the applicant has taken with that provider is no longer approved, or\n    3.   (c) from a test centre which is no longer approved, or\n    4.   (d) past its validity date (if a validity date is required), provided that it is at or above the requisite level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and when the subsequent application is made the award to the applicant does not fall within the circumstances set out in paragraph 32B of this Appendix.",

Exceptions apply if alternative evidence of nationality is provided.\n\n### Evidence of English Language Requirements\n\n1.   27. The evidence required of passing an English language test in speaking and listening (at a minimum of level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) with a provider approved by the Secretary of State, where the applicant relies on that pass to meet an English language requirement, is confirmation on the on-line verification system operated by an approved English language test provider and at an approved Secure English Language Test centre that: \n    1.   (i) the applicant has passed such a test; and\n    2.   (ii) that test was an English language test in speaking and listening which is approved by the Secretary of State and was taken no more than two years before the date of application and at a test centre approved by the Secretary of State as a Secure English Language Test Centre or if they have already shown they met the requirement in this manner at the level required for their current application, in a previous successful application for entry clearance or permission to stay.\n\n2.   28. The evidence required to show that a person is a citizen or national of a majority English speaking country is a valid passport or travel document, unless paragraphs 29 and 30 apply. A dual national may invoke either of their nationalities.\n3.   29. If the applicant has not provided their passport or travel document other evidence of nationality can be supplied in the following circumstances only (as indicated by the applicant on their application form): \n    1.   (a) where the passport or travel document has been lost or stolen;\n    2.   (b) where the passport or travel document has expired and been returned to the relevant authorities; or\n    3.   (c) where the passport or travel document is with another part of the Home Office.\n\n4.   30. Alternative evidence as proof of nationality, if acceptable, must be either: \n    1.   (a) A current national identity document; or\n    2.   (b) A letter from the applicant\u2019s national government, Embassy or High Commission confirming the applicant\u2019s full name, date of birth and nationality.\n\n5.   31. Evidence of an academic qualification under paragraphs 284(ix)(c), (d) and (e), 290 (viii) (c), (d) and (e) and 295D(xi)(c), (d) and (e) of Part 8 and paragraphs E-ECP.4.1.(c), E-LTRP.4.1.(c), E-LTRP.4.1A.(c), E-ECPT.4.1.(c), E-LTRPT.5.1.(c) and E-LTRPT.5.1A.(c) of Appendix FM must be: \n    1.   (a) a certificate issued by the relevant institution confirming the award of the academic qualification showing: \n        1.   (i) the applicant\u2019s name;\n        2.   (ii) the title of award;\n        3.   (iii)the date of award; and\n        4.   (iv)the name of the awarding institution; or\n\n    2.   (b) if the applicant is awaiting graduation or no longer has the certificate and cannot obtain a new one, either: \n        1.   (i) an academic reference from the institution awarding the academic qualification that: \n            1.   1) is on official letter headed paper;\n            2.   2) shows the applicant\u2019s name;\n            3.   3) shows the title of award;\n            4.   4) explains when the academic qualification has been, or will be, awarded; and\n            5.   5) confirms either the date that the certificate will be issued (if the applicant has not yet graduated) or that the institution is unable to re-issue the certificate of award; or\n\n        2.   (ii) an academic transcript that: \n            1.   (1) is on official letter headed paper;\n            2.   (2) shows the applicant\u2019s name;\n            3.   (3) shows the name of the academic institution;\n            4.   (4) shows the course title; and\n            5.   (5) confirms either the date that the certificate will be issued (if the applicant has not yet graduated) or that the institution is unable to re-issue the certificate of award; and\n\n    3.   (c) if the qualification was awarded by an educational establishment outside the UK, a document from Ecctis which confirms that the qualification meets or exceeds the recognised standard of a Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s degree or PhD in the UK and was taught or researched in English to level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common Framework of Reference for Languages or above.\n\n6.   32. If the qualification was taken in one of the following countries, it will be assumed for the purpose of paragraph 31 that it was taught or researched in English: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Overseas Territories, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Ireland, Jamaica, New Zealand, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, the UK, the USA, Malta.\n7.   32A. For the avoidance of doubt paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix apply to fianc\u00e9(e), proposed civil partner, spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner and same sex partner applications for limited leave to enter or remain made under Part 8 of these Rules where English language requirements apply, regardless of the date of application. Paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix also apply to spouse, civil partner, unmarried partner and same sex partner applications which do not meet the requirements of Part 8 of these Rules for indefinite leave to remain (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) and are being considered for a grant of limited leave to remain where paragraph A277A(b) of these Rules applies. Any references in paragraphs 27 to 32D of this Appendix to \u201climited leave to enter or remain\u201d shall therefore be read as referring to all applicants referred to in this paragraph.\n8.   32B. Where the decision-maker has: \n    1.   (a) reasonable cause to doubt that an English language test in speaking and listening at a minimum of level A1 or A2 (as the case may be) of the Common Framework of Reference for Languages relied on at any time to meet a requirement for limited leave to enter or remain in Part 8 or Appendix FM was genuinely obtained; or\n    2.   (b) information that the test certificate or result awarded to the applicant has been withdrawn by the test provider for any reason,\n    3.   the decision-maker may discount the test certificate or result and require the applicant to provide a new test certificate or result from an approved provider which shows that they meet the requirement, if they are not exempt from it.\n\n9.   32C. If an applicant applying for limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 or Appendix FM submits an English language test certificate or result which has ceased by the date of application to be: \n    1.   (a) from an approved test provider, or\n    2.   (b) in respect of an approved test, or\n    3.   (c) from an approved test centre, the decision-maker will not accept that certificate or result as valid, unless the decision-maker does so in accordance with paragraph 32D of this Appendix and subject to any transitional arrangements made in respect of the test provider, test or test centre in question.\n\n10.   32D. If an applicant applying for limited leave to enter or remain under Part 8 or Appendix FM submits an English language test certificate or result and the Home Office has already accepted it as part of a successful previous application in any route (but not where the application was refused, even if on grounds other than the English language requirement), the decision-maker will accept that certificate or result as valid if it is: \n    1.   (a) from a provider which is no longer approved, or\n    2.   (b) from a provider who remains approved but the test the applicant has taken with that provider is no longer approved, or\n    3.   (c) from a test centre which is no longer approved, or\n    4.   (d) past its validity date (if a validity date is required), provided that it is at or above the requisite level of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and when the subsequent application is made the award to the applicant does not fall within the circumstances set out in paragraph 32B of this Appendix.",
