Immigration Rules Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland

It is the responsibility of the employer or company or self-employed individual, to ensure that the total number of days worked by its employees, or the self- employed individual, does not exceed 90 in each calendar year. The 90-day limitation applies irrespective of the number of eligible contracts that are held.

This route does not allow for dependants to accompany or join the Service Provider from Switzerland in the UK.
