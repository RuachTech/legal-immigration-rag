Any other person who wishes to ascertain in advance whether they are eligible for admission to the United Kingdom may apply for the issue of an entry clearance.

1.   25. Entry clearance takes the form of a visa (for visa nationals) or an entry certificate (for non visa nationals). A visa or an entry certificate may be issued in electronic form. These documents are to be taken as evidence of the holder’s eligibility for entry into the United Kingdom, and accordingly accepted as “entry clearances” within the meaning of the Immigration Act 1971.
2.   25A. An entry clearance which satisfies the requirements set out in article 3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 will have effect as leave to enter the United Kingdom.

5.   28. An applicant for an entry clearance must be outside the United Kingdom and Islands at the time of the application. An application for an entry clearance as a visitor or as a short-term student or under Appendix Ukraine Scheme must be made to any post designated by the Secretary of State to accept such applications. Subject to paragraph 28A, any other application must be made to a post in the country or territory where the applicant is living which has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant. Where there is no such post the applicant must apply to the appropriate designated post outside the country or territory where he is living.

6.   28A (a) An application for entry clearance under Appendix Temporary Work-Creative Worker or Appendix International Sportsperson, where the applicant is applying for a period of permission of 12 months or less, may also be made at the post in the country or territory where the applicant is situated at the date of application, provided that:

    2.   (ii) the applicant is in that country or territory for a similar purpose to the activity they propose to undertake in the UK; and

        1.   (i) the post has been designated by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance for that purpose and from that category of applicant; and
        2.   (ii) the applicant is able to demonstrate to the Entry Clearance Officer that they have been given permission to live in that country or territory in accordance with its immigration laws and that the permission was given for a period of more than 6 months.

1.   29. For the purposes of paragraph 28 “post” means a British Diplomatic Mission, British Consular post or the office of any person outside the United Kingdom and Islands who has been authorised by the Secretary of State to accept applications for entry clearance. A list of designated posts is published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
2.   30. An application for an entry clearance is not made until any fee required to be paid under the regulations made under sections 68 and 69 of the Immigration Act 2014 has been paid.
3.   30A. DELETED.

Medical, Show
-------------

1.   36. A person who intends to remain in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months should normally be referred to the Medical Inspector for examination. If he produces a medical certificate he should be advised to hand it to the Medical Inspector. Any person seeking entry who mentions health or medical treatment as a reason for his visit, or who appears not to be in good mental or physical health, should also be referred to the Medical Inspector; and the Immigration Officer has discretion, which should be exercised sparingly, to refer for examination in any other case.
2.   37. Where the Medical Inspector advises that a person seeking entry is suffering from a specified disease or condition which may interfere with his ability to support himself or his dependants, the Immigration Officer should take account of this, in conjunction with other factors, in deciding whether to admit that person. The Immigration Officer should also take account of the Medical Inspector’s assessment of the likely course of treatment in deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his disposal.
3.   38. A returning resident should not be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds. But where a person would be refused leave to enter or have existing leave to enter or remain cancelled on medical grounds if he were not a returning resident or in any case where it is decided on compassionate grounds not to exercise the power to refuse leave to enter or to cancel existing leave to enter or remain, or in any other case where the Medical Inspector so recommends, the Immigration Officer should give the person concerned a notice requiring him to report to the Medical Officer of Environmental Health designated by the Medical Inspector with a view to further examination and any necessary treatment.

(b) If the decision-maker has reasonable cause to doubt (on examination or interview or on any other basis) that any evidence submitted by or on behalf of an applicant for the purposes of satisfying the requirements of Appendix KoLL of these Rules was genuinely obtained, that evidence may be discounted for the purposes of the application.
    2.   (c) Where sub-paragraph (b) applies, the decision-maker may give the applicant a further opportunity to demonstrate sufficient knowledge of the English language and about life in the United Kingdom in accordance with paragraph 3.2 or 3.3 of Appendix KoLL.
    3.   (d) A decision-maker may decide not to give the applicant a further opportunity under sub-paragraph (c) where the decision-maker does not anticipate that the supply of further evidence will lead to a grant of leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom because the application may be refused for other reasons.
