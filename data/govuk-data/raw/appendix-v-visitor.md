Immigration Rules Appendix V: Visitor
=====================================

Immigration Rules for Visitors

This route is for a person who wants to visit the UK for a temporary period, (usually for up to 6 months), for purposes such as tourism, visiting friends or family, carrying out a business activity, or undertaking a short course of study.

Each Visitor must meet the requirements of the Visitor route, even if they are travelling as, for example, a family group, a tour group or a school party.

A visa national as set out in Appendix Visitor: Visa National list must obtain entry clearance as a Visitor (a visit visa) before arrival in the UK.

A non-visa national can normally seek entry on arrival in the UK.

There are 4 types of Visitor:

*   Standard Visitor: for those seeking to undertake the activities set out in Appendix Visitor: Permitted Activities, for example tourism and visiting family, usually for up to 6 months. A Standard Visitor may apply for a visit visa of six months, two, five or 10 years validity, however each stay in the UK must not exceed the permitted length of stay endorsed on the visit visa (usually six months).
*   Marriage/Civil Partnership Visitor: for those seeking to come to the UK to marry or form a civil partnership, or give notice of marriage or civil partnership.
*   DELETED.
*   Transit Visitor: for those who want to transit the UK on route to another country outside the Common Travel Area and who will enter the UK for up to 48 hours by crossing the UK border unless Appendix Visitor: Transit Without Visa Scheme applies.
*   Diplomatic Visa Arrangement (DVA) Visitor: for individuals holding a valid diplomatic passport who are visiting the UK, nominated through a Note Verbale from their sending government. DVA Visitors may apply for a visit visa for 2 years validity, however each stay in the UK must not exceed 6 months.

Visitors cannot work in the UK unless this is expressly allowed under the permitted activities set out in Appendix Visitor: Permitted Activities.

Further information of how long each Visitor can stay and what they can and cannot do in the UK is set out at V 17.2 and Appendix Visitor: Permitted Activities.

The DVA Visitor application process will open on 18 February 2025 for nationals set out at V15A.4 who intend to travel to the UK on or after 11 March 2025.
