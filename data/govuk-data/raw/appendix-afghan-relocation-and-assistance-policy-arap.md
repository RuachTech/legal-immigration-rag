Immigration Rules Appendix Afghan Relocation and Assistance Policy (ARAP)
=========================================================================

This route is for Afghan citizens and their dependent family members to relocate to, or settle in, the UK where the Ministry of Defence has decided they meet the requirements for relocation to the UK as an eligible Afghan citizen under the ARAP (“the ARAP eligibility decision”).

An eligible Afghan citizen may include a partner, dependent children and additional family members who are eligible under the ARAP in their application.

There is a two-stage application process. An application must first be made, by the applicant, to the Ministry of Defence, who will decide if the applicant is an eligible Afghan citizen or an eligible dependant. If they are eligible for relocation to the UK, the second stage is that the Ministry of Defence will on behalf of the applicant, make an application to the Home Office for entry clearance (if they are outside the UK) or settlement (if they are in the UK).

Where an applicant satisfies the requirements for entry clearance or settlement under Appendix ARAP, they will be granted settlement in the UK.

Applications by an Afghan citizen must have been submitted to the Ministry of Defence before 15:00 BST on 01 July 2025.
