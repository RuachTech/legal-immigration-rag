Immigration Rules Appendix Long Residence
=========================================

The Long Residence route is for a person who has lived in the UK lawfully and continuously for 10 years or more. The person can count time with permission on most routes towards the 10 year qualifying period.

There is no provision for dependents of a person on the Long Residence route to apply on this route.

A person may apply for immediate settlement if they meet all the requirements for settlement or may apply for temporary permission to stay if they meet the suitability and qualifying period and continuous residence requirements but do not meet the English language or Knowledge of life in the UK requirements.

A person who has lived in the UK for a long period but has not been lawfully and continuously resident for 10 years may be eligible to apply under Appendix Private Life.
