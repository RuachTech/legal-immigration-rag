### Definition of asylum applicant

1.   327. Under this Part: 
    1.   i) An “application for asylum” (or an “asylum application”) is a claim by a person to be recognised as a refugee under the Refugee Convention on the basis that it would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Refugee Convention for them to be removed from or required to leave the United Kingdom, and which is recorded as valid or a claim deemed to be an application for asylum in accordance with paragraph 327EC.
    2.   ii) An “asylum applicant” is someone who makes a claim under paragraph 327(i) or who is deemed to have made such a claim in accordance with paragraph 327EC.

2.   327A. DELETED
3.   327AB. An application for asylum will only be recorded as valid if: 
    1.   i) it is made at a designated place as defined in section 14 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 unless subsequently or otherwise accepted by the Secretary of State; and
    2.   ii) it is made in person; and
    3.   iii) it is made by a person who is not a British Citizen; and
    4.   iv) it is particularised (if the applicant is 18 or over); and
    5.   v) it does not fall for consideration under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules, unless and until it has been accepted as a fresh claim under paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules.

4.   327AC. If a claim does not meet these requirements, it will not be recorded as a valid asylum application.
5.   327B. DELETED
6.   327C. DELETED
7.   327D. DELETED

### Definition of a claim for humanitarian protection

327EA. Under this Part, a claim for humanitarian protection is a request by a person for international protection due to a claim that if they are removed from or required to leave the UK, they would face a real risk of suffering serious harm (as defined in paragraph 339CA) in their country of origin, and they are unable, or owing to such risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.

327EB. A claim for humanitarian protection must meet the requirements of paragraphs 327AB(i) to (iv) otherwise it will not be recorded as a valid claim for humanitarian protection.

327EC. If someone makes a claim for humanitarian protection, they will be deemed to be an asylum applicant and to have made an application for asylum for the purposes of these Rules. The claim will be recorded, subject to meeting the requirements of Rule 327AB(i) to (iv), as an application for asylum and will be assessed under paragraph 334 for refugee status in the first instance. If the application for refugee status is refused, then the Secretary of State will go on to consider the claim as a claim for humanitarian protection.

### Inadmissibility of a claim for Humanitarian Protection

327F. If an application for asylum is declared inadmissible under section 80A or 80B of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 then any associated claim for humanitarian protection (meaning a claim made on the same facts) will also be inadmissible. Such an outcome is not a decision to refuse the claim and, accordingly, no right of appeal under section 82(1)(a) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (appeal against refusal of protection claim) arises.

### Applications for asylum

1.   328. All asylum applications will be determined by the Secretary of State in accordance with the Refugee Convention and the Immigration Rules. Every asylum application made by a person at a port or airport in the United Kingdom will be referred by the Immigration Officer for determination by the Secretary of State in accordance with these Rules.
2.   328A. DELETED
3.   329. For so long as an asylum applicant cannot be removed from or required to leave the UK because section 77 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies, any dependants who meet the definition under paragraph 349 must also not be removed from or required to leave the UK.
4.   330. If the Secretary of State decides to grant refugee status or humanitarian protection and the person has not yet been given leave to enter, the Immigration Officer will grant limited leave to enter.
5.   331. If a person seeking leave to enter is refused asylum or their application for asylum is withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph 333C of these Rules, the Immigration Officer will consider whether or not they are in a position to decide to give or refuse leave to enter without interviewing the person further. If the Immigration Officer decides that a further interview is not required they may serve the notice giving or refusing leave to enter by post. If the Immigration Officer decides that a further interview is required, they will then resume their examination to determine whether or not to grant the person leave to enter under any other provision of these Rules. If the person fails at any time to comply with a requirement to report to an Immigration Officer for examination, the Immigration Officer may direct that the person’s examination shall be treated as concluded at that time. The Immigration Officer will then consider any outstanding applications for entry on the basis of any evidence before them.
6.   332. If a person who has been refused leave to enter makes an application for asylum and that application is refused or withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph 333C of these Rules, leave to enter will again be refused unless the applicant qualifies for admission under any other provision of these Rules.
7.   333. Written notice of decisions on applications for asylum shall be given to the asylum applicant. Where the applicant is legally represented, notice may instead be given to the representative. Where the applicant has no legal representative and free legal assistance is not available, they shall be informed of the decision on the application for asylum and, if the application is refused, how to challenge the decision, in a language that they may reasonably be supposed to understand.
8.   333A. The Secretary of State shall ensure that a decision is taken on each application for asylum as soon as possible, without prejudice to an adequate and complete examination.
9.   Where a decision on an application for asylum has not been taken within: 
    1.   a) six months of the date it was recorded; or
    2.   b) within any revised timeframe notified to an applicant during or after the initial six-month period in accordance with this paragraph, and
    3.   c) where the applicant has made a specific written request for an update,

10.   the Secretary of State shall inform the applicant of the delay and provide information on the timeframe within which the decision on their application is to be expected. The provision of such information shall not oblige the Secretary of State to take a decision within the expected timeframe.

333B. Applicants for asylum shall be allowed an effective opportunity to consult, at their own expense or at public expense in accordance with provision made for this by the Legal Aid Agency or otherwise, a person who is authorised under Part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to give immigration advice. This paragraph shall also apply where the Secretary of State is considering revoking a person’s refugee status in accordance with these Rules.

### Withdrawal of applications

1.   333C. If an application for asylum is withdrawn either explicitly or implicitly, it will not be considered. 
    1.   (a) An application will be treated as explicitly withdrawn if the applicant signs the relevant form provided by or on behalf of the Secretary of State, or otherwise explicitly declares a desire to withdraw their asylum claim.
    2.   (b) An application may be treated as implicitly withdrawn if the applicant: 
        1.   (i) fails to maintain contact with the Home Office or provide up to date contact details as required by paragraph 358B of these Rules; or
        2.   (ii) leaves the United Kingdom (without authorisation) at any time before the conclusion of their application for asylum; or
        3.   (iii) fails to complete an asylum questionnaire as requested by or on behalf of the Secretary of State; or
        4.   (iv) fails to attend any reporting events, unless the applicant demonstrates within a reasonable time that the failure was due to circumstances beyond their control; or
        5.   (v) fails to attend a personal interview required under paragraph 339NA, unless the applicant demonstrates within a reasonable time that that failure was due to circumstances beyond their control.

    3.   (c) The applicant’s asylum record will be updated to reflect that the application for asylum has been withdrawn.

### Grant of refugee status

1.   334. An asylum applicant will be granted refugee status in the United Kingdom following a claim if the Secretary of State is satisfied that: 
    1.   (i) they are in the United Kingdom or have arrived at a port of entry in the United Kingdom; and
    2.   (ii) they are a refugee, as defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Refugee Convention; and
    3.   (iii) there are no reasonable grounds for regarding them as a danger to the security of the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention; and
    4.   (iv) having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, they do not constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention as defined in Section 72 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; and
    5.   (v) refusing their application would result in them being required to go (whether immediately or after the time limited by any existing leave to enter or remain in the UK) in breach of the Refugee Convention, to a country in which they would be persecuted on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group.

2.   335. If the Secretary of State decides to grant refugee status to a person who has previously been given leave to enter (whether or not the leave has expired) or to a person who has entered without leave, the Secretary of State will vary the existing leave or grant limited leave to remain. Where a person has an existing grant of indefinite leave to remain, their leave to remain will not be varied.

### Refusal of asylum

1.   336. An application which does not meet the criteria set out in paragraph 334 will be refused. Where an application for asylum is refused, the reasons in fact and law shall be stated in the decision and information provided in writing on how to challenge the decision.
2.   337. DELETED
3.   338. DELETED
4.   339. DELETED

### Revocation of refugee status

1.   338A. A person’s grant of refugee status under paragraph 334 must be revoked if any of paragraphs 339A, 339AA, 339AB or 339AC apply.

### Refugee Convention ceases to apply (cessation)

1.   339A. This paragraph applies when the Secretary of State is satisfied that one or more of the following applies: 
    1.   (i) they have voluntarily re-availed themselves of the protection of the country of nationality;
    2.   (ii) having lost their nationality, they have voluntarily re-acquired it;
    3.   (iii) they have acquired a new nationality, and enjoy the protection of the country of their new nationality;
    4.   (iv) they have voluntarily re-established themselves in the country which they left or outside which they remained owing to a fear of persecution;
    5.   (v) they can no longer, because the circumstances in connection with which they have been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, continue to refuse to avail themselves of the protection of the country of nationality; or
    6.   (vi) being a stateless person with no nationality, they are able, because the circumstances in connection with which they have been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, to return to the country of former habitual residence

In considering (v) and (vi), the Secretary of State shall have regard to whether the change of circumstances is of such a significant and non-temporary nature that the refugee’s fear of persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded.

### Exclusion from the Refugee Convention

1.   339AA. This paragraph applies where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person should have been, or is, excluded from being a refugee in accordance with Article 1D and 1E of the 1951 Refugee Convention and Article 1F of the Refugee Convention, as defined in section 36 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

### Misrepresentation

1.   339AB. This paragraph applies where the Secretary of State is satisfied that the person’s misrepresentation or omission of facts, including the use of false documents, were decisive for the grant of refugee status and the person does not otherwise qualify for refugee status under paragraph 334.

### Danger to the United Kingdom

1.   339AC. This paragraph applies where the Secretary of State is satisfied that: Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention applies in that:

The person concerned shall be informed in writing that the Secretary of State is reconsidering their qualification for refugee status or humanitarian protection and the reasons for the reconsideration. That person shall be given the opportunity to submit, in a personal interview or in a written statement, reasons as to why their refugee status or humanitarian protection should not be revoked. If there is a personal interview, it shall be subject to the safeguards set out in these Rules.

1.   339BB. The procedure in paragraph 339BA does not need to be followed where the person:

### Consideration of applications

1.   339HA. The Secretary of State shall ensure that the personnel examining applications for asylum and taking decisions on the Secretary of State’s behalf have the knowledge with respect to relevant standards applicable in the field of asylum and refugee law.
2.   339I. When the Secretary of State considers an applicant’s protection claim, or human rights claim it is the duty of the person to submit to the Secretary of State as soon as possible all material factors needed to substantiate the protection claim or substantiate the human rights claim, which the Secretary of State shall assess in cooperation with the person.

    1.   (i) the person’s statement on the reasons for making protection claim or for making a human rights claim; and
    2.   (ii) all documentation at the person’s disposal regarding the person’s age, background (including background details of relevant relatives), identity, nationality(ies), country(ies) and place(s) of previous residence, previous asylum applications, travel routes; and

    1.   (i) information provided in support of an application and the fact that an application has been made shall not be disclosed to the alleged actor(s) of persecution of the applicant, and
    2.   (ii) information shall not be obtained from the alleged actor(s) of persecution that would result in their being directly informed that an application for asylum has been made by the applicant in question and would jeopardise the physical integrity of the applicant and their dependants, or the liberty and security of their family members still living in the country of origin.

This paragraph shall also apply where the Secretary of State is considering revoking a person’s refugee status or humanitarian protection in accordance with these Rules.

1.   339J. The assessment by the Secretary of State of a protection claim or a human rights claim will be carried out on an individual, objective and impartial basis. This will include taking into account in particular: 
    1.   (i) all relevant facts as they relate to the country of origin at the time of taking a decision on the grant; including laws and regulations of the country of origin or country of return and the manner in which they are applied;
    2.   (ii) relevant statements and documentation presented by the person including information on whether the person has been or may be subject to persecution or serious harm;
    3.   (iii) the individual position and personal circumstances of the person, including factors such as background, gender and age, so as to assess whether, on the basis of the person’s personal circumstances, the acts to which the person has been or could be exposed would amount to persecution or serious harm;
    4.   (iv) whether the person’s activities since leaving the country of origin were engaged in for the sole or main purpose of creating the necessary conditions for making a protection claim or a human rights claim, so as to assess whether these activities will expose the person to persecution or serious harm if returned to that country; and
    5.   (v) whether the person could reasonably be expected to avail themselves of the protection of another country where they could assert citizenship.

2.   339JA. Reliable and up-to-date information shall be obtained from various sources as to the general situation prevailing in the countries of origin of applicants for asylum and, where necessary, in countries through which they have transited. Such information shall be made available to the personnel responsible for examining applications and taking decisions and may be provided to them in the form of a consolidated country information report.

This paragraph shall also apply where the Secretary of State is considering revoking a person’s refugee status or humanitarian protection in accordance with these Rules.

1.   339K. The fact that a person has already been subject to persecution or serious harm, or to direct threats of such persecution or such harm, will be regarded as a serious indication of the person’s well-founded fear of persecution or real risk of suffering serious harm, unless there are good reasons to consider that such persecution or serious harm will not be repeated.
2.   339L. It is the duty of the person to substantiate the protection claim or substantiate their human rights claim. Where aspects of the person’s statements are not supported by documentary or other evidence, those aspects will not need confirmation when all of the following conditions are met: 
    1.   (i) the person has made a genuine effort to substantiate their protection claim or substantiate their human rights claim;
    2.   (ii) all material factors at the person’s disposal have been submitted, and a satisfactory explanation regarding any lack of other relevant material has been given;

    4.   (iv) the person has made a protection claim or made a human rights claim at the earliest possible time, unless the person can demonstrate good reason for not having done so; and
    5.   (v) the general credibility of the person has been established.

1.   339M. The Secretary of State may consider that a person has not substantiated their protection claim or substantiated their human rights claim, and thereby refuse their application for asylum, determine that they are not eligible for humanitarian protection or refuse their human rights claim, if they fail, without reasonable explanation, to make a prompt and full disclosure of material facts, either orally or in writing, or otherwise to assist the Secretary of State in establishing the facts of the case; this includes, for example, failure to report to a designated place to be fingerprinted, failure to complete an asylum questionnaire or failure to comply with a requirement to report to an immigration officer for examination.
2.   339MA. Applications for asylum shall be neither rejected nor excluded from examination on the sole ground that they have not been made as soon as possible.
3.   339N. In determining whether the general credibility of the person has been established the Secretary of State will apply the provisions in s.8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.

### Personal interview

    1.   (i) the Secretary of State is able to take a positive decision (a grant of refugee status or humanitarian protection) on the basis of evidence available;
    2.   (ii) the Secretary of State has already had a meeting with the applicant for the purpose of assisting them with completing their application and submitting the essential information regarding the application;
    3.   (iii) the applicant, in submitting their application and presenting the facts, has only raised issues that are not relevant or of minimal relevance to the examination of whether they are a refugee, as defined in Article 1 of the Refugee Convention and/or has only raised issues that are not relevant or of minimal relevance to the examination of whether they are eligible for humanitarian protection;
    4.   (iv) the applicant has made inconsistent, contradictory, improbable or insufficient representations which make their claim clearly unconvincing in relation to having been the object of persecution or serious harm;
    5.   (v) the applicant has submitted a subsequent application which does not raise any relevant new elements with respect to their particular circumstances or to the situation in their country of origin;
    6.   (vi) the applicant is making an application merely in order to delay or frustrate the enforcement of an earlier or imminent decision which would result in their removal;
    7.   (vii) it is not reasonably practicable, in particular where the Secretary of State is of the opinion that the applicant is unfit or unable to be interviewed owing to enduring circumstances beyond their control; or
    8.   (viii) the applicant is an EU national whose claim the Secretary of State has nevertheless decided to consider substantively in accordance with section 80A(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

The omission of a personal interview shall not prevent the Secretary of State from taking a decision on the application.

Where the personal interview is omitted, the applicant and dependants shall be given a reasonable opportunity to submit further information.

1.   339NB. (i) The personal interview mentioned in paragraph 339NA above shall normally take place without the presence of the applicant’s family members unless the Secretary of State considers it necessary for an appropriate examination to have other family members present.

2.   (ii) The Secretary of State shall ensure that the applicant has timely access to the report of the personal interview and that access is possible as soon as necessary for allowing an appeal to be prepared and lodged in due time.
3.   339ND The Secretary of State shall provide at public expense an interpreter for the purpose of allowing the applicant to submit their case, wherever necessary. The Secretary of State shall select an interpreter who can ensure appropriate communication between the applicant and the representative of the Secretary of State who conducts the interview.
4.   339NE The Secretary of State may require an audio recording to be made of the personal interview referred to in paragraph 339NA. Where an audio recording is considered necessary for the processing of an application for asylum, the Secretary of State shall inform the applicant in advance that the interview will be recorded.

### Internal relocation

1.   339O 
    1.   (i) The Secretary of State will not: 
        1.   (a) grant refugee status if section 35 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 applies; or
        2.   (b) grant humanitarian protection if in part of the country of origin a person would not face a real risk of serious harm, and the person can reasonably be expected to stay in that part of the country.

    2.   (ii) Any assessment under paragraph 339O(i)(b) must: 
        1.   (a) have regard to the general circumstances prevailing in that part of the country, and
        2.   (b) have regard to the personal circumstances of the person; and
        3.   (c) disregard any technical obstacles relating to travel to that part of that country.

### Sur place claims

1.   339P. A person may have a well-founded fear of being persecuted or a real risk of suffering serious harm based on events which have taken place since the person left the country of origin and/or activities which have been engaged in by a person since they left the country of origin, in particular where it is established that the activities relied upon constitute the expression and continuation of convictions or orientations held in the country of origin.

### Permission to stay on a protection route

1.   339QA. Where the Secretary of State has granted an asylum applicant refugee status under paragraph 334, the asylum applicant will be granted permission to stay on a protection route at the same time as or as soon as possible after the grant of refugee status.
2.   Permission to stay on a protection route will be valid for a minimum period of 5 years and renewable upon application where the person still has and remains eligible for refugee status. Applications for further permission to stay on a protection route under this Part should be made within the last 28 days of the applicant’s permission to stay.

339QB. Where the Secretary of State has granted an asylum applicant humanitarian protection under paragraph 339C, the asylum applicant will be granted permission to stay on a protection route at the same time as or as soon as possible after the grant of humanitarian protection. Permission to stay on a protection route will be valid for a minimum period of 5 years and will be renewable upon application where the person still has and remains eligible for humanitarian protection. Applications for further permission to stay on a protection route under this Part should be made within the last 28 days of the applicant’s permission to stay.

339QC. Where the Secretary of State has granted an asylum applicant refugee status or humanitarian protection, any dependant of the asylum applicant who meets the requirements of paragraph 349 may be granted permission to stay. Permission to stay will not be granted to dependants where they would, if they were an asylum applicant, be excluded under Article 1(F) of the 1951 Refugee Convention (as defined in Section 36 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022), be refused refugee status under paragraph 334(iii) or paragraph 334(iv), or be excluded from humanitarian protection under paragraph 339D. Permission to stay will be granted with the same expiry date and with the same conditions as that which is granted to the asylum applicant. Permission to stay will be renewable upon application where the dependant still meets the requirements of the Rules under which they were granted, and the asylum applicant who was granted refugee status or humanitarian protection is being granted further permission to stay at the same time or already has further permission to stay. An adult who was last granted permission to stay as a dependent child of a parent who has or had at the time that permission to stay as a dependant was granted, permission to stay on a protection route, may still qualify for further permission to stay as a dependant where they meet the other requirements of the Rules under which they were granted permission to stay. Applications for further permission to stay should be made at the same time as the asylum applicant’s application and within the last 28 days of the applicant’s permission to stay.

339QD. The Secretary of State may curtail, revoke or refuse to grant further permission to stay on a protection route under paragraphs 339QA or 339QB where a person’s refugee status or humanitarian protection is revoked.

339QE. The Secretary of State may curtail, revoke or refuse to grant further permission to stay on a protection route to a dependant granted permission to stay on a protection route under paragraph 339QC where the refugee status or humanitarian protection of the applicant on whom they are a dependant is revoked, or where they no longer meet the requirements of the Rules under which they were granted.

### Travel documents

1.   344A(i). After having received a complete application for a travel document, the Secretary of State will issue to a person in the United Kingdom who meets the definition of a refugee in Article 1 of the Refugee Convention and their dependants travel documents, in the form set out in the Schedule to the Refugee Convention, for the purpose of travel outside the United Kingdom, unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.
2.   (ii) After having received a complete application for a travel document, the Secretary of State will issue to a person granted humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom and their dependants a travel document where that person is unable to obtain a national passport or other identity documents which enable that person to travel, unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.
3.   (iii) Where the person referred to in (ii) can obtain a national passport or identity documents but has not done so, the Secretary of State will issue that person with a travel document where that person can show that they have made reasonable attempts to obtain a national passport or identity document and there are serious humanitarian reasons for travel.
4.   (iv) For the purposes of paragraph 344A, a “dependant” refers only to a person who has been treated as a dependant under paragraph 349 of these Rules or a person who has been granted permission to stay or entry clearance in accordance with Appendix Family Reunion (Sponsors with Protection) of these Rules.

### Access to Employment

1.   344B. The Secretary of State will not impose conditions restricting the employment or occupation in the United Kingdom of a person granted refugee status or humanitarian protection.

### Information

1.   344C. A person who is granted refugee status or humanitarian protection will be provided with access to information in a language that they may reasonably be supposed to understand which sets out the rights and obligations relating to that status. The Secretary of State will provide the information as soon as possible after the grant of refugee status or humanitarian protection.

### Dependants

1.   349. A partner, or minor child, accompanying a principal applicant may be included in the application for asylum as a dependant, provided, in the case of an adult dependent partner with legal capacity, the partner consents to being treated as a dependant at the time the application is lodged. A partner or minor child may also claim asylum in their own right. If the principal applicant is granted refugee status or humanitarian protection and leave to enter or remain any partner or minor child will be granted leave to enter or remain for the same duration. The case of any dependant who claims asylum in their own right will be also considered individually in accordance with paragraph 334 above. An applicant under this paragraph, including an accompanied child, may be interviewed where they make a protection claim as a dependant or in their own right.

If the partner or minor child in question has a protection claim in their own right, that claim should be made at the earliest opportunity. Any failure to do so will be taken into account and may damage credibility if no reasonable explanation for it is given. Where an asylum or humanitarian protection application is unsuccessful, at the same time that asylum or humanitarian protection is refused the applicant may be notified of removal directions or served with a notice of the Secretary of State’s intention to deport them, as appropriate. In this paragraph and paragraphs 350-352 a child means a person who is under 18 years of age or who, in the absence of documentary evidence establishing age, appears to be under that age.

### Unaccompanied children

1.   350. Unaccompanied children may also make a protection claim and, in view of their potential vulnerability, particular priority and care is to be given to the handling of their cases.
2.   351. A person of any age may qualify for refugee status under the Convention and the criteria in paragraph 334 apply to all cases. However, account should be taken of the applicant’s maturity and in assessing the protection claim of a child more weight should be given to objective indications of risk than to the child’s state of mind and understanding of their situation. An asylum application made on behalf of a child should not be refused solely because the child is too young to understand their situation or to have formed a well founded fear of persecution. Close attention should be given to the welfare of the child at all times.
3.   352. Any child aged 12 or over who has made a protection claim in their own right must be given the opportunity to be interviewed about the substance of their claim before a decision is taken.
4.   The opportunity for a personal interview may be omitted for a child aged 12 or over where: 
    1.   (a) the child is unfit to be interviewed; or
    2.   (b) the child is unable to be interviewed; or
    3.   (c) protection status can be granted to the child without an interview based on the evidence available; or
    4.   (d) one of the exceptions in paragraph 339NA applies.

5.   Where the personal interview is omitted, the child must be given a reasonable opportunity to submit further information if insufficient information is available to take a decision on protection status. If the interview can be omitted and the child still requests an asylum interview, then this request must be considered.
6.   When an interview takes place: 
    1.   (a) it must be conducted in the presence of a parent, guardian, representative or another adult independent of the Secretary of State who has responsibility for the child; and
    2.   (b) the interviewer must have specialist training in the interviewing of children; and
    3.   (c) the child must be allowed to express themselves in their own way and at their own speed and, if they appear tired or distressed, the interview should be suspended, and the interviewer should consider whether it would be appropriate for the interview to be resumed the same day or on another day.

352ZA. The Secretary of State must, as soon as possible after an unaccompanied child makes a protection claim, take measures to ensure that the child has a person to represent and/or assist the child with respect to the examination of their claim and ensure that the representative is given the opportunity to inform the child about the meaning and possible consequences of the interview and, where appropriate, how to prepare themselves for the interview.

The child’s representative has the right to be present at the interview and ask questions and make comments in the interview, within the framework set by the interviewer.

For the purposes of paragraph 352 and 352ZA a representative can include a legal representative, social worker, local authority representative, independent child trafficking guardian, Scottish guardianship service representative, Northern Ireland independent guardian service representative, foster carer, relative, a Refugee Council representative or charity worker or other representative permitted to attend by the Secretary of State.

352ZB. The decision on the application for asylum shall be taken by a person who is trained to deal with protection claims from children.

### Requirements for limited leave to remain as an unaccompanied asylum seeking child.

1.   352ZC The requirements to be met in order for a grant of limited leave to remain to be made in relation to an unaccompanied asylum seeking child under paragraph 352ZE are:

    5.   e) there are no reasonable grounds for regarding the applicant as a danger to the security of the United Kingdom;
    6.   f) the applicant does not constitute a danger to the community in the United Kingdom as a result of having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime (as defined in section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002); and
    7.   g) the applicant is not, at the date of their application, the subject of a deportation order or a decision to make a deportation order.

1.   352ZD An unaccompanied asylum seeking child is a person who: 
    1.   a) is under 18 years of age when the asylum application is submitted.
    2.   b) is applying for asylum in their own right; and
    3.   c) is separated from both parents and is not being cared for by an adult who in law or by custom has responsibility to do so.

2.   352ZE. Limited leave to remain should be granted for a period of 30 months or until the child is 17 ½ years of age whichever is shorter, provided that the Secretary of State is satisfied that the requirements in paragraph 352ZC are met.
3.   352ZF. Limited leave granted under this provision will cease if 
    1.   a) any one or more of the requirements listed in paragraph 352ZC cease to be met, or
    2.   b) a misrepresentation or omission of facts, including the use of false documents, were decisive for the grant of leave under 352ZE.
