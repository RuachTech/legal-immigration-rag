Immigration Rules Appendix Settlement Family Life
=================================================

This route is for a person who has permission to stay as a partner or parent (or has had a combination of the two) under Appendix FM, and who is eligible to settle in the UK after a qualifying period of 10 years.

The person may also be able to count time with permission on other routes towards the 10 year qualifying period, if certain conditions are met.

Alternatively, partners, parents and their dependent children may qualify for settlement on the basis of 10 years Long Residence in the UK, under paragraphs 276A to 276D or 298 of the rules.

Where a person has permission as a partner and the relationship has broken down due to domestic abuse, the applicant may be able to qualify for settlement as a victim of domestic abuse under Appendix FM.

Where a person has permission as a partner and their partner has died, the applicant may be able to qualify for settlement as a bereaved partner under Appendix FM.

Dependent children of a partner or parent who is applying to settle on this route may also qualify for settlement under these Rules.

Children born in the UK where a parent is settled in the UK will be British citizens by birth. There are registration routes for British Citizenship for children born in the UK before their parent is settled: either once a parent is granted settlement or if the child lives in the UK for the first 10 years of their life. Other children may also apply for registration as a British citizen at the Home Secretary’s discretion: Registration as a British citizen: children - GOV.UK [(www.gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/immigration-rules/www.gov.uk).
