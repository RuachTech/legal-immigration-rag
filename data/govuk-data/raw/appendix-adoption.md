Immigration Rules Appendix Adoption
===================================

The adoption routes are for a child under the age of 18 to apply to come to the UK either to be adopted or having been adopted overseas.

If a child is granted temporary permission under Appendix Adoption, they would need to apply for settlement under paragraph 298 in Part 8; or for settlement on the route their adoptive parent is on.

Where an adoption has taken place in a country where the adoption is recognised under UK law and the adoptive parent(s) were resident in that country at the time of the adoption, the adopted child may make an application as a dependent child on the same route as their parent(s).

There are four adoption routes:

**Hague Convention:** this route applies where the adoption is via an adoption agency under the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. Most Hague Convention adoptions will be completed overseas, however for some countries the adoption is completed in the UK and the child must apply for entry clearance to come to the UK for the adoption to be completed.

**Recognised Overseas Adoptions:** this route allows a child to apply for entry clearance to come to the UK where they have been adopted overseas in a country where the adoption is recognised under UK law, or where the adoption has been recognised by order of the High Court in the UK.

**De facto Adoption:** this route is for a child to apply for entry clearance where the child has been living with their adoptive parent(s) overseas for at least 12 months and there has been a genuine transfer of parental responsibility.

**Coming to the UK for adoption:** this route is for a child to apply for entry clearance where they are in a country whose adoptions are not recognised in the UK and the child is coming to the UK to be adopted under UK law. Where applicable the relevant UK authority must have issued the adopters with a certificate of eligibility to adopt.

Adoption is a route to settlement.
