Immigration Rules Appendix Child Relative (Sponsors with Protection)
====================================================================

Appendix Child Relative (Sponsors with Protection)

Appendix Child Relative (Sponsors with Protection) is also known as Appendix CRP.

Under Appendix CRP, a child may apply for either entry clearance or permission to stay with or join their close relative who has protection status in the UK and is not settled.

Under Appendix CRP, if a person wishes to stay with their close relative and apply for settlement in the UK, they can apply at the same time as their close relative, or after their close relative is settled in the UK, providing they have or last had entry clearance or permission to stay under Appendix CRP.

There is a separate entry clearance route for a child to join a relative who is settled in the UK under paragraph 297 of Part 8.
