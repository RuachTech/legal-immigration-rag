    6.   (f) Refuse an application under paragraph HV9.1 of Appendix S2 Healthcare Visitor because the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements for permission to enter or remain as an S2 Healthcare Visitor; or
    7.   (g) Cancel permission to enter to a person who holds entry clearance under Appendix S2 Healthcare Visitor, where, since the entry clearance was granted, there has been a change in circumstances which means the person no longer meets the eligibility requirements for permission to enter; or
    8.   (h) Refuse permission to enter to a non-visa national seeking to come to the UK as an S2 Healthcare Visitor for 6 months or less, because they do not meet the eligibility requirements of Appendix S2 Healthcare Visitor; or

    3.   (b) Refuse an application under paragraph HV9.1 of Appendix S2 Healthcare Visitor where the suitability requirements are not met; or

    5.   (d) Refuse an application for entry clearance under paragraph SPS 7.1 of Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland because the applicant does not meet the suitability requirements of that Appendix; or
    6.   (e) Refuse permission to enter to a person who holds an entry clearance under Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland, where, since the entry clearance was granted, there has been a change in circumstances which means the person no longer meets the suitability requirements for permission to enter unless permission has been cancelled on arrival in the UK under paragraph SPS9.1(c) of that Appendix.

AR(EU)1.3. An applicant may not apply for an administrative review where their application has been rejected as invalid under paragraph EU10(1) of Appendix EU, paragraph HV1.7. of Appendix S2 Healthcare Visitor or paragraph SPS 1.4. of Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland.

Consideration, Show

        3.   (iii) entry clearance or permission to enter under Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland.
