Where a sponsor wishes to issue a Certificate of Sponsorship for reasons of continuity involving a performer that has worked on the same piece of work overseas for less than one month, the Sponsor must notify Equity at least 5 working days prior to the issuing of the certificate with details of the filming schedules. This is in order to verify that the applicant is being genuinely engaged for reasons of continuity.

For such Certificate of Sponsorship, neither the one month requirement nor prior notice to Equity procedure applies.

3. Highly specialist or unusual roles

For certain highly specialist or unusual roles, it may not be possible or reasonable to recruit from the UK because the role requires specific or specialist attributes, including but not limited to: physical appearance; physical talent and linguistic or vocal skills. In such circumstances, where appropriate, Sponsors should first attempt to conduct searches in the UK as set out in category 3 to a reasonable degree. However, it is recognised that the extent of such searches within the UK shall be proportionate to the rarity and specialty of the attributes of the role. The Sponsor must be able to provide proof:

• that the role requires certain highly specialist attributes; and

• that the performer possesses those attributes; and

• of the casting process and casting considerations; and

• of reasonable and appropriate searches in the UK (if applicable); and

• a list of any UK candidates who were unavailable at the required time.

• The name of the programme concerned; and

• Details of any recording or filming schedules.

6. Performers who do not meet the key criteria but who are commercially important

The applicant must be commercially important to the production. This may be demonstrated by a formal letter in support from a principal financier, or distributor. The sponsor must give prior notice to Equity providing supporting evidence detailing: description of the role and film, and the reasons why advertising was not appropriate and a letter in support. The sponsor must provide Equity with:

• the details of the performer(s)required, role, description of the production; and

• the reasons why the role has not been advertised; and,

• a formal letter in support of the applicant from a financier or distributor; and

• if the performer is an up-and-coming performer, or cast to appeal to a particular overseas audience, then evidence of their CV, reviews, previous work, awards/accolades, and/or evidence of audience appeal would be required.

Sponsors issuing CoSs to performers taking part in international co-productions structured under one of the UK’s bilateral co- production treaties, or under the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production, need to provide the following evidence:

The Sponsor must be able to provide documentary proof that it would not be reasonable to expect the sponsor to undertake a resident labour market search e.g. in relation to the above example, proof that the role requires certain highly specialised skills e.g. job description; and that the applicant possesses those skills e.g. qualifications, CV, credits.

Required advertising media for other posts• For roles where formal advertising is not the usual industry practice for recruiting for a particular role:

These are those models who have sufficient a level of experience that they are already established, if not in the UK, certainly in their own or other markets. They may already be known to UK clients or will certainly have been pre-marketed, however, photographs alone are not sufficient, except for models flying in for a particular job.

i. Evidence of previous engagements or of commercial

status in the UK, and/or

ii. Evidence of working in markets other than the UK

Models must meet 65% of the eligibility criteria for the Modelling Industry, as endorsed by the British Fashion Council. Sponsors must be able to provide evidence of which criteria are met.
Required endorsement for those falling outside the above criteria A British Fashion Council approved panel will be put in place to endorse specific models with real potential that are unable to fulfil the required four criteria, which is most likely to occur within the New Faces category. Applications will still be required to be scored against the criteria and the supporting documents submitted to the Panel to enable them to make a decision.
Sponsors must be able to demonstrate panel approval when issuing CoS.
