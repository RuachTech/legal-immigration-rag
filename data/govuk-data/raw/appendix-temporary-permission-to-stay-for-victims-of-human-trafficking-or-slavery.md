Immigration Rules Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery
===================================================================================================

This route is to provide for temporary permission to stay for victims of human trafficking or slavery and their children.

The applicant must be in the UK.

A confirmed victim as classified in VTS 1.1 (a), who has not been considered for permission to stay under this route, need not apply under this route, as for those in scope permission to stay will be automatically considered following a positive Conclusive Grounds decision. A confirmed victim who has been considered previously for permission to stay under this route or the Discretionary Leave for victims of Modern Slavery policy and has been refused permission to stay cannot apply or re-apply under this route.

Individuals who already have permission to stay as a victim of human trafficking or slavery, or as their child dependents, or who have been granted Modern Slavery Discretionary Leave as a victim of human trafficking or slavery, or as their child dependents can apply to extend their permission under this route.

The suitability and eligibility requirements set out at VTS 2.1 and 3.1-3.4 below will apply both to first time applicants under this route and those applying to extend an existing grant of permission to stay under this route or a grant of Modern Slavery discretionary leave that has not expired.

This route is not a route to settlement.
