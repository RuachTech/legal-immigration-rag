1.   SCU 6.2. The sponsor must have chosen an appropriate SOC 2020 occupation code, and the decision maker must not have reasonable grounds to believe the sponsor has chosen a less appropriate SOC 2020 occupation code for any of the following reasons:

### Appropriate salary requirement for Sponsored Application

1.   SCU 7.1. The salary for the job for which the applicant is being sponsored must equal or exceed all of the following:

1.   SCU 7.3. Salary does not include other pay and benefits, such as any of the following: 
    1.   (a) pay which cannot be guaranteed because the nature of the job means that hours fluctuate; or
    2.   (b) additional pay such as shift, overtime or bonus pay, (whether or not it is guaranteed); or

    4.   (d) any allowances, such as accommodation or cost of living allowances; or

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £15 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £37,440 (£15 x 48 x 52) per year and not £46,800 (£15 x 60 x 52).

1.   SCU 7.4A. If the applicant is being sponsored to work a pattern where the regular hours are not the same each week, resulting in uneven pay: 
    1.   (a) work in excess of 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary threshold of £39,100, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week; and
    2.   (b) any unpaid rest weeks will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met; and
    3.   (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. in Part Suitability of these rules.

2.   For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £15 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of just £31,200 (£15 x 40 x 52) per year.

1.   SCU 7.5. Going rates in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations are based on a 37.5-hour week and will be pro-rated to the applicant’s working pattern, as follows: 
    1.   (a) (the going rate for the SOC 2020 occupation code stated in Table 2 of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5)
    2.   (b) the applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.

SCU 7.6. If the requirements in SCU 5.1. to SCU 7.5. are met, the applicant will be awarded 50 points for meeting the Sponsored Application requirements.

    2.   (b) any payments made by the applicant to other parties; and
