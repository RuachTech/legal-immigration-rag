Immigration Rules Appendix Ukraine Scheme
=========================================

Appendix Ukraine Scheme

This Appendix sets out 2 routes for those affected by the conflict in Ukraine: the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme for those applying from outside the UK and the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme for those applying in the UK for further permission to stay for up to 18 months.

**Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme**

A Ukrainian national who is outside the UK may qualify under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme if they have an Approved sponsor who will provide them with accommodation for at least 6 months.

A child who is not applying with, or intending to join, their parent or legal guardian in the UK must have an Approved sponsor who was approved for the child by a Local Authority before the application is made, and must have agreed to accommodate the child for at least 18 months or until the child is 18 years old (whichever is soonest), so long as the child is sponsored for at least 6 months.

Immediate family members of a Ukrainian national who are not themselves Ukrainian may also qualify under the Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme.

**Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme**

A person in the UK may qualify under the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme if they hold, or have previously held, permission under Appendix Ukraine Scheme (which, for the purposes of this Appendix, includes the now closed Ukraine Family Scheme and Ukraine Extension Scheme).

Children born in the UK to Ukrainian nationals who have permission under Appendix Ukraine Scheme are eligible to apply under the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme.

The Ukraine Family Scheme (which was available to eligible Ukrainian nationals with an eligible UK based family member sponsor) closed to new applications at 1500GMT on 19 February 2024.

The Ukraine Extension Scheme (which was available to eligible Ukrainian nationals or their close family members) closed to most new applications on 16 May 2024. It remained open to children born in the UK to parents who had permission under any of the Ukraine Schemes. The scheme closed in its entirety at 0900GMT on 4 February 2025.

The Ukraine Schemes (including the now closed Ukraine Family Scheme and Ukraine Extension Scheme) are not a route to settlement.
