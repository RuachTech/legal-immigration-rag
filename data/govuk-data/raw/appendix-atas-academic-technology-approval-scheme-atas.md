Immigration Rules Appendix ATAS: Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)
===========================================================================

ATAS seeks to prevent the transfer of information, knowledge or technology which could develop, advance or support an Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT) and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programme or their means of delivery.

The ATAS requirement means the applicant must obtain a valid ATAS certificate, issued by the Counter-Proliferation and Arms Control Centre, and to provide it with an application on Student, Skilled Worker, ICT, Global Business Mobility, Scale-up, Temporary Work – International Agreement and Temporary Work – Government Authorised Exchange routes to study or work as a researcher in any of the specified subjects listed in this Appendix.

The ATAS condition means that someone must obtain a valid ATAS certificate prior to commencing study or research in any of the specified subjects or fields of research.

A person is subject to the ATAS condition if they have been granted permission which allows study or work subject to the ATAS condition.

A person is exempt from the ATAS requirement and ATAS condition if they are a national of one of the countries listed in this Appendix.
