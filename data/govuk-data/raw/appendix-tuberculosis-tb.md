1.   TB3: A TB certificate is valid only if it: 
    1.   (a) was issued by a medical practitioner approved by the Secretary of State for the purpose of these rules, as listed on the Gov.uk website; and

1.   TB4. A person may be required to provide a new valid TB certificate before the application for entry clearance is granted, if:

    2.   (b) the applicant otherwise meets the requirements to be granted entry clearance.
