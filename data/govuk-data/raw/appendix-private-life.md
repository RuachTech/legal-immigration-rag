Immigration Rules Appendix Private Life
=======================================

The Private Life route is for a person seeking permission to stay in the UK on the basis they have developed a Private Life in the UK.

A child born in the UK to a person who has permission on the Private Life route can apply for permission for the same duration as their parent.

The Private Life route is a route to settlement.

A child born in the UK who has been continuously resident for 7 years may qualify for immediate settlement on this route.

Alternative routes may be available to those considering the Private Life route. For example, a person may be able to qualify for immediate settlement on the basis of 10 years Long Residence in the UK, under Appendix Long Residence of these rules.
