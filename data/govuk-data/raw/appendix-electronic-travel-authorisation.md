Immigration Rules Appendix Electronic Travel Authorisation
==========================================================

Appendix Electronic Travel Authorisation

An Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) is required by specified nationals in advance of travel to the UK.

The holder of an ETA will need to obtain permission to enter on arrival in the UK but can be refused entry if they require an ETA and do not have one.

An application for an ETA may be granted through automated processing. A person who is refused an ETA has not been refused permission to enter the UK and will need to apply for a visa if they wish to come to the UK.

A person who already holds a valid entry clearance, or permission to enter or stay, is not required to obtain an ETA.

The ETA application process opened on 25 October 2023 for nationals set out at Immigration Rules Appendix ETA National List ETANL 1.1(a) who intend to travel to the UK on or after 15 November 2023.

The ETA application process then opened on 1 February 2024 for nationals set out at Immigration Rules Appendix ETA National List ETANL 1.1(b) who intend to travel to the UK on or after 22 February 2024.

The ETA application process will open on 27 November 2024 for nationals set out at Immigration Rules Appendix ETA National List ETANL 1.1(c) who intend to travel to the UK on or after 8 January 2025.

The ETA application process will then open on 5 March 2025 for nationals set out at Immigration Rules Appendix ETA National List ETANL 1.1(d) who intend to travel to the UK on or after 2 April 2025.
