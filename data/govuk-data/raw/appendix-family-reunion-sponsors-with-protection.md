Immigration Rules Appendix Family Reunion (Sponsors with Protection)
====================================================================

Appendix Family Reunion (Sponsors with Protection)

This Appendix, also known as refugee family reunion, is now closed to new applications pending a review. For those who applied under Appendix Family Reunion (Sponsors with Protection) as a partner or child of a person with protection status before 1500 on 4 September 2025, the Appendix FRP rules in place on that date will apply to a pre-flight partner or dependent child applying to stay with or join a person who has protection status or settlement on a protection route in the UK.

There is a separate route under Appendix Child Relative (Sponsors with Protection) for a child to stay with or join a close relative, for example a sibling, who has protection status in the UK.

There is a separate route under Appendix FM: family members for a partner or child to join a sponsor who has protection status, is settled or a British Citizen in the UK on the basis of their family life.
