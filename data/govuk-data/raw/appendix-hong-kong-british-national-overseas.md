Immigration Rules Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas)
================================================================

There are two Hong Kong British National (Overseas) routes– the BN(O) Status Holder route and the BN(O) Household Member route.

The BN(O) Status Holder route is for a British National (Overseas) status holder who is ordinarily resident in Hong Kong, the UK or the Crown Dependencies. A dependent partner and a dependent child of a British National (Overseas) status holder can apply under this route. Other family members with a high degree of dependency may also apply under this route.

The BN(O) Household Member route is for the adult child of a BN(O) status holder or of the partner of a BN(O) status holder who is aged 18 or over and born on or after 1 July 1997. The child of a BN(O) status holder’s dependent partner, dependent child and in exceptional circumstances, other family members with a high degree of dependency may apply under this route. The adult child of the partner of a BN(O) status holder may apply with their dependent partner and dependent child, but they must all apply at the same time as the BN(O) status holder and form part of the same household as them.

The Hong Kong British National (Overseas) routes allow work and study in the UK and are routes to settlement.
