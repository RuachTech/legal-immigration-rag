Immigration Rules Appendix Adult Dependent Relative
===================================================

The Adult Dependent Relative route is for a person aged 18 or over who is sponsored by a relative in the UK (who must be a British Citizen, settled in the UK, have protection status or be a specified EEA national who has permission under Appendix EU) and where the sponsor is able to maintain, accommodate and care for the applicant without reliance on public funds.

The applicant must require long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks due to age, illness or disability and that care must be either not available or not affordable in the country where the applicant is living.

The applicant must apply for and obtain entry clearance as an Adult Dependent Relative before their arrival in the UK.

The partner of an Adult Dependent Relative may also apply for entry clearance as an Adult Dependent Relative if they are the partner of either the parent or grandparent of the sponsor who is applying at the same time.

Where a couple, who are both the parents or grandparents of the sponsor, are applying as Adult Dependent Relatives only one of them needs to require long-term personal care.

An Adult Dependent Relative is granted settlement if their sponsor is settled in the UK or is a British Citizen. In other cases, the Adult Dependent Relative is granted temporary permission which expires on the same date as their sponsor’s temporary permission and once in the UK they can apply for settlement or further permission to stay in line with their sponsor’s permission.

There is a separate route for an Adult Dependent Relative of a BN(O) Status Holder under Appendix Hong Kong British National (Overseas).
