Immigration Rules Appendix Skilled Occupations
==============================================

Eligible SOC 2020 occupation codes and going rates for Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility and Scale-up routes

1.   In this Appendix: 
    1.   • “SW” refers to the Skilled Worker route
    2.   • “GBM” refers to the Global Business Mobility routes
    3.   • “GTR” refers to the Global Business Mobility - Graduate Trainee route
    4.   • “SCU” refers to the Scale-up route

Table 1: Eligible SOC 2020 occupation codes and related going rates based on median Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These SOC 2020 occupation codes are considered to be skilled to Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 6 or above, and are eligible for the Skilled Worker route. This table relates to points options A-E set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.

Going rates in Table 1 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options A to E refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.

1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: 
    1.   • the rate shown by the median ASHE data for that occupation; or
    2.   • £17.13 per hour

For the avoidance of doubt, where £17.13 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £17.13 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.

Only the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.

| SOC 2020 occupation code | Examples of related job titles (non-exclusive) | Going rate (SW – options A and D) | 90% of going rate (SW – option B) | 80% of going rate (SW – option C) | 70% of going rate (SW – option E) | Eligible for PhD points (SW)? |

Table 2: Eligible SOC 2020 occupation codes and related going rates based on 25th percentile Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These SOC 2020 occupation codes are considered to be skilled to Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 6 or above, and are eligible for the Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility and Scale-up routes. This table relates to points options F-J set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.

Going rates in Table 2 are per year and based on a 37.5-hour working week. They must be pro-rated for other working patterns, based on the weekly working hours stated by the applicant’s sponsor. Options F to J refer to the points options set out in Appendix Skilled Worker.

1.   The going rates and associated reductions which apply are whichever is the higher of: 
    1.   • the rate shown by the 25th percentile ASHE data for that occupation; or
    2.   • £12.82 per hour

For the avoidance of doubt, where £12.82 per hour calculates as more than 70%, 80% or 90% of the stated going rate, £12.82 will nevertheless be taken to be 70%, 80% or 90% of the going rate, as applicable.

Only the going rate column applies to Skilled Worker settlement applications; the columns setting out 70%, 80% and 90% of the going rate do not apply.

Equivalent SOC 2010 occupation codes are included where they were previously eligible for the Skilled Worker route, for ease of matching to the relevant SOC 2020 occupation codes for applicants being sponsored to continue working in the same occupation.

These SOC 2020 occupation codes are not eligible for the Global Business Mobility or Scale-up routes.
