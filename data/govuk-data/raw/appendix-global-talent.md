Immigration Rules Appendix Global Talent
========================================

The Global Talent route is for people aged 18 or over in the field of science, engineering, humanities, social science, medicine, digital technology or arts and culture who can show they have exceptional talent or exceptional promise.

For most individuals there is a two-part application process. The first part is an application for endorsement (guidance on the relevant evidence and its format is set out from time to time by the Secretary of State on gov.uk/global talent); the second part is an application for entry clearance or permission to stay.

A person can make the application for endorsement before making the application for permission, or they can make both applications at the same time.

Alternatively, a person who has been awarded a prestigious prize listed in Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes is considered as showing exceptional talent and is therefore not required to apply for an endorsement.

A dependent partner and dependent children can apply under this route.

Global Talent is a route to settlement.
