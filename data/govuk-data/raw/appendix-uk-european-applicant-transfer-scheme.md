Immigration Rules Appendix UK/European Applicant Transfer Scheme
================================================================

Immigration Rules Appendix UK/European Applicant Transfer Scheme

Under the UK/European Applicant Transfer Scheme (‘Scheme’), the Secretary of State will transfer a limited number of people from France to the UK. The total number of people transferred to the UK will correlate with the number of people who are removed from the UK under the pilot arrangement on the prevention of dangerous journeys.

Applicants to the UK/European Applicant Transfer Scheme must be aged 18 or over at the time they submit their application, unless they are applying with a family member who is over the age of 18.

There is a two-stage application process under the Scheme. An applicant must first submit an Expression of Interest application.

The Scheme operates application windows for Expression of Interest applications to be submitted. The Secretary of State for the Home Department will determine any application window. Expression of Interest applications submitted outside an application window will be rejected.

Expression of Interest applications that are made from outside France will not be considered. For Expressions of Interest applications made from within France, the Home Office will decide which Expression of Interest applications will proceed to Entry Clearance, in line with prioritisation criteria set out in guidance for the Scheme.

Any outstanding Expression of Interest applications at the time the pilot closes will be rejected.

When an Expression of Interest application is selected, the Home Office will complete an application for entry clearance on behalf of the applicant. Entry clearance applications will be considered against the requirements set out in these Rules.

The Secretary of State may, at their discretion, pause consideration of applications under the scheme to assess whether the volume required to match returns has been met, and will close the scheme when the volume required has been reached.

This Scheme cannot be used to apply for leave outside the Rules.

Definitions, Show
-----------------

For the purposes of this Appendix, a “family group” means two or more applicants who are related to one another as a parent, child or partner, who have confirmed on their Expression of Interest application that they are applying with other family members.

For the purposes of this Appendix, a “family reference number” means the reference provided to an applicant who applies first and indicates that they are applying as part of a family group. That applicant then provides the family reference number to all other members of the family group for them to provide as part of their Expression of Interest application.

For the purposes of this Appendix, “the cap’’ means the total number of individuals removed from the UK through the pilot arrangement on prevention of dangerous journeys at the end of the pilot period.

For the purposes of this Appendix, “application window” means a period determined by the Secretary of State for the Home Department in which Expression of Interest applications may be submitted under the UK/European Applicant Transfer Scheme, having regard to the need to meet the cap.
