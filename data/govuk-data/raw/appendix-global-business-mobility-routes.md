Markdown Content:
The Global Business Mobility routes are for workers based outside the UK who are undertaking a temporary work assignment in the UK as a Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier or Secondment Worker.

The Global Business Mobility – Senior or Specialist Worker route is for overseas workers who are undertaking temporary work assignments in the UK, where the worker is a senior manager or specialist employee and is being assigned to a UK business linked to their employer overseas. This type of assignment is often called an intra-company transfer or ICT.

A partner and dependent children can apply to come to the UK on this route.

SNR 8.1. The general salary requirement is £52,500 per year, unless SNR 8.3 applies.

SNR 8.2. If the applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, subject to SNR 8.2A, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week will be considered towards the general salary requirement.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £20 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £49,920 (£20 x 48 x 52) per year and not £62,400 (£20 x 60 x 52).

    1.   (a) work in excess of 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary threshold of £52,500, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week; and
    2.   (b) any unpaid rest weeks will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met; and
    3.   (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. in Part Suitability of these rules.

2.   For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £20 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of just £41,600 (£20 x 40 x 52) per year.

### Transitional general salary requirement for a Senior or Specialist Worker

SNR 8.3. The applicant does not need to meet the general salary requirement if the applicant is applying for permission to stay and was previously granted permission as a Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) Migrant under the rules in force before 6 April 2011, or as a Work Permit Holder and since then has continuously had permission as a Senior or Specialist Worker (including any period of overstaying disregarded under the Exceptions for overstayers section of Part Suitability).

SNR 9.1. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate, which will be calculated as follows:

1 x (the going rate for the SOC 2020 occupation code stated in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5).

SNR 9.2. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the health or education SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate (and the going rate will be pro-rated according to the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor, and the pro-rating set out in Appendix Skilled Occupations).

SNR 9.3. The applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week in a SOC 2020 occupation code with a going rate of £75,000 must be paid £120,000 (1 x £75,000 x 60 ÷ 37.5) per year, not £96,000 (1 x £75,000 x 48 ÷ 37.5).

SNR 11.1. to SNR 11.3. do not apply and there is no maximum period of permission if the applicant is applying for permission to stay and was previously granted permission as a Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) Migrant under the rules in force before 6 April 2011, or as a Work Permit Holder and since then has continuously had permission as a Senior or Specialist Worker (including any period of overstaying disregarded under the Exceptions for overstayers section of Part Suitability).

### Points for salary for a Graduate Trainee

1.   GTR 7.1. The salary for the job for which the applicant is being sponsored must equal or exceed both: 
    1.   (a) the general salary requirement in GTR 8.1. and GTR 8.2.; and

GTR 8.2. If the applicant is being sponsored to work more than 48 hours a week, subject to GTR 8.3, only the salary for the first 48 hours a week will be considered towards the general salary requirement.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week for £8 per hour will be considered to have a salary of £19,968 (£8 x 48 x 52) per year and not £24,960 (£8 x 60 x 52).

1.   GTR 8.3. If the applicant is being sponsored to work a pattern where the regular hours are not the same each week, resulting in uneven pay: 
    1.   (a) work in excess of 48 hours in some weeks can be considered towards the salary threshold of £27,300, providing the average over a regular cycle (which can be less than, but not more than, 17 weeks) is not more than 48 hours a week; and
    2.   (b) any unpaid rest weeks will count towards the average when considering whether the salary thresholds are met; and
    3.   (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. in Part Suitability of these rules.

2.   For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 45 hours a week for £15 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 30 hours a week on average and have a salary of just £23,400 (£15 x 30 x 52) per year.

### Going rate requirement for a Graduate Trainee

GTR 9.1. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 70% of the pro-rated going rate, which will be calculated as follows:

0.7 x (the going rate for the occupation code stated in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5).

GTR 9.2. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the health or education SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate (and the going rate will be pro-rated according to the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor, and the pro-rating set out in Appendix Skilled Occupations).

GTR 9.3. The applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week in a SOC 2020 occupation code with a going rate of £37,500 must be paid £42,000 (0.7 x £37,500 x 60 ÷ 37.5) per year, not £33,600 (0.7 x £37,500 x 48 ÷ 37.5).

### Genuineness requirement for a Graduate Trainee

    1.   (a) genuinely intend, and be able, to undertake the role for which they are being sponsored; and
    2.   (b) not intend to undertake employment other than in the role for which they are being sponsored, or as otherwise permitted by GTR 13.1.

GTR 10.1. If the applicant is applying for permission to stay and has been living in the UK with permission for 12 months or longer on the date of application, they will meet the financial requirement and do not need to show funds.

1.   GTR 10.2. If the applicant is applying for entry clearance or has been living in the UK for less than 12 months on the date of application either: 
    1.   (a) the applicant must have funds of at least £1,270; or
    2.   (b) the applicant’s A-rated sponsor must confirm on the Certificate of Sponsorship that they will, if it is necessary, maintain and accommodate the applicant up to the end of the first month of their employment to an amount of at least £1,270.

GTR 10.3. If GTR 10.2.(a) applies, the applicant must show that they have held the required level of funds for a 28-day period and as set out in Appendix Finance.

### Maximum length of assignments requirement for a Graduate Trainee

GTR 11.1. The grant of permission must not lead to the applicant being granted cumulative periods of permission on the Global Business Mobility routes and Intra-Company routes totalling more than 5 years in any 6-year period.

1.   GTR 11.2. When calculating the cumulative periods of permission referred to in GTR 11.1. and GTR 13.2.(c), the decision maker will include the following: 
    1.   (a) all previous permission on the Global Business Mobility routes; and
    2.   (b) all previous permission on the Intra-Company routes; and
    3.   (c) if the applicant does not currently hold permission on a Global Business Mobility route, any permission they could be granted under the current application, beginning on the start date of the job stated on the Certificate of Sponsorship; and
    4.   (d) if the applicant is applying for permission to stay and has or last had permission on a Global Business Mobility route, any permission they could be granted under the current application, beginning on the date of decision; and

    3.   (c) any unpaid rest weeks will not count as absences from employment for the purpose of paragraph SUI 36.1. in Part Suitability of these rules.

2.   For example, an applicant who works a pattern of 60 hours a week for £20 per hour for two weeks, followed by an unpaid rest week, will be considered to work 40 hours a week on average and have a salary of just £41,600 (£20 x 40 x 52) per year.

UKX 9.1. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate, which will be calculated as follows:

1 x (the going rate for the SOC 2020 occupation code stated in Table 2 or Table 2b of Appendix Skilled Occupations) x (the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor ÷ 37.5).

UKX 9.2. If the applicant is being sponsored for a job in one of the health or education SOC 2020 occupation codes listed in Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, the going rate requirement is 100% of the pro-rated going rate (and the going rate will be pro-rated according to the number of weekly working hours stated by the sponsor, and the pro-rating set out in Appendix Skilled Occupations).

UKX 9.3. The applicant’s full weekly hours will be included when checking their salary against the going rate, even if they work more than 48 hours a week.

For example, an applicant who works 60 hours a week in a SOC 2020 occupation code with a going rate of £75,000 must be paid £120,000 (1 x £75,000 x 60 ÷ 37.5) per year, not £96,000 (1 x £75,000 x 48 ÷ 37.5).

    1.   (a) genuinely intend, and be able, to undertake the role for which they are being sponsored; and

    2.   (b) all previous periods of permission on the Intra-Company routes; and
