========================================

Family members (paragraphs A277 to 319Y).

Show all sections

Transitional provisions and interaction between Part 8, Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE, Show
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A277 From 9 July 2012 Appendix FM will apply to all applications to which Part 8 of these rules applied on or before 8 July 2012 except where the provisions of Part 8 are preserved and continue to apply, as set out in paragraphs A280 to A280B.

A277A. Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for limited leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant or Appendix W Worker), and where the applicant:

(a) does not meet the requirements of Part 8 for indefinite leave to remain, (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) and

(b) meets or continues to meet the requirements for limited leave to remain under Part 8 in force at the date of decision,

subject to compliance with any requirement notified under paragraph A277D(b), further limited leave to remain under Part 8 may be granted of such a period and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems appropriate. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph an applicant last granted limited leave to enter under Part 8 will be considered as if they had last been granted limited leave to remain under Part 8.

(c) DELETED

A277B. Where the Secretary of State is considering an application for limited leave to remain or indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply (excluding an application from a family member of a Relevant Points Based System Migrant or Appendix W Worker) and where the application does not meet the requirements for indefinite leave to remain (where the application is for indefinite leave to remain) or limited leave to remain under Part 8 in force at the date of decision:

(a) the application will also be considered as a partner, parent or child under Appendix FM (family life) in line with paragraphs R-LTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRC.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) and under Appendix Private Life; and

(b) if the applicant meets the requirements for leave as a partner, parent or child under the relevant paragraphs of Appendix FM or under Appendix Private Life (except the requirement for a valid application under that route), the applicant will (subject to compliance with any requirement to pay an Immigration Health Charge notified under paragraph A277D(b)) be granted leave. If the applicant meets provisions in both Appendix FM and Appendix Private Life, the applicant will be granted on Appendix Private Life if the applicant is a child or young adult (as that provides a shorter route to settlement), otherwise the applicant will be granted on Appendix FM; and

(c) if the applicant is granted leave under those provisions, the period of the applicant’s continuous leave under Part 8 at the date of application will be counted towards the period of continuous leave which must be completed before the applicant can apply for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B or Appendix Settlement Family Life or Appendix Private Life.

A277C. Subject to paragraphs A277 to A280B and paragraph GEN.1.9. of Appendix FM, the Secretary of State may consider any application to which the provisions of Appendix FM (family life) and Appendix Private life of these rules do not apply, under paragraphs RLTRP.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRPT.1.1.(a), (b) and (d), R-LTRC.1.1.(a), (b) and (d) of Appendix FM (family life) and Appendix Private life of these rules. If the applicant meets the requirements for leave under those provisions (except the requirement for a valid application), the applicant will be granted leave under paragraph D-LTRP.1.2., D-LTRPT.1.2. or DLTRC.1.1. of Appendix FM or under Appendix Private Life.

1.   A277D. Where, pursuant to paragraphs A277A to A277C, a person who has made an application for indefinite leave to remain to which Part 8 of these rules continues to apply does not meet the requirements for indefinite leave to remain but falls to be granted limited leave to remain under Part 8, Appendix Private Life or Appendix FM, or outside the rules on Article 8 grounds: 
    1.   (a) The Secretary of State will treat that application for indefinite leave to remain as an application for limited leave to remain;
    2.   (b) The Secretary of State will notify the applicant in writing of any requirement to pay an immigration health charge under the Immigration (Health Charge) Order 2015; and
    3.   (c) If there is such a requirement and that requirement is not met, the application for limited leave to remain will be invalid and the Secretary of State will not refund any application fee paid in respect of the application for indefinite leave to remain.

A278 The requirements to be met under Part 8 after 9 July 2012 may be modified or supplemented by the requirements in Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE.

A279. Paragraphs 13.2.1.- 13.3.2. apply to all immigration decisions made further to applications under Part 8 and paragraphs 276A-276D where a decision is made on or after 28 July 2014, irrespective of the date the application was made.

1.   277. Nothing in these Rules shall be construed as permitting a person to be granted entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain or variation of leave as a spouse or civil partner of another if either the applicant or the sponsor will be aged under 18 on the date of arrival in the United Kingdom or (as the case may be) on the date on which the leave to remain or variation of leave would be granted. In these rules the term “sponsor” includes “partner” as defined in GEN 1.2 of Appendix FM.
2.   278. Nothing in these Rules shall be construed as allowing a person to be granted entry clearance, leave to enter, leave to remain or variation of leave as the spouse and civil partner of a man or woman (the sponsor) if: 
    1.   (i) his or her marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor is polygamous; and
    2.   (ii) there is another person living who is the husband or wife of the sponsor and who: 
        1.   (a) is, or at any time since his or her marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor has been, in the United Kingdom; or
        2.   (b) has been granted a certificate of entitlement in respect of the right of abode mentioned in Section 2(1)(a) of the Immigration Act 1988 or an entry clearance to enter the United Kingdom as the husband or wife of the sponsor.

For the purpose of this paragraph a marriage or civil partnership may be polygamous although at its inception neither party had any other spouse or civil partner.

    1.   (i) he or she has been in the United Kingdom before 1 August 1988 having been admitted for the purpose of settlement as the husband or wife of the sponsor; or
    2.   (ii) he or she has, since their marriage or civil partnership to the sponsor, been in the United Kingdom at any time when there was no such other spouse or civil partner living as is mentioned in paragraph 278 (ii).

But where a person claims that paragraph 278 does not apply to them because they have been in the United Kingdom in circumstances which cause them to fall within sub paragraphs (i) or (ii) of that paragraph it shall be for them to prove that fact.

1.   280. For the purposes of paragraphs 278 and 279 the presence of any wife or husband in the United Kingdom in any of the following circumstances shall be disregarded: 
    1.   (i) as a visitor; or
