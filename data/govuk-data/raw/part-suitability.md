Immigration Rules: Part Suitability
===================================

Part Suitability

Part Suitability applies to most routes under these Rules (see section 1).

If an applicant is refused under this Part, they will not meet the suitability requirements of the route on which they are applying.

A person may also have their entry clearance or permission cancelled under this Part. The Immigration Act 1971, section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (revocation of indefinite leave), the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) Order 2000 and Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 provide the powers to cancel entry clearance and permission. This Part sets out how those powers are to be exercised.

Where a person has settlement and is in-country (not including at the UK border) their permission can only be cancelled on the grounds contained in section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Decisions on suitability are either mandatory (must) or discretionary (may). Where a refusal under this Part would be incompatible with the UK obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) the route specific rules set out the approach to be taken.

Some routes have their own, or additional, suitability requirements.

This Part is in 5 sections.

1.   1. Application of this Part
2.   2. Grounds for refusal, or cancellation, of entry clearance or permission
3.   3. Additional grounds for refusal or entry, or cancellation of entry clearance or permission, on arrival in the UK
4.   4. Additional grounds for refusal, or cancellation of permission to stay
5.   5. Additional grounds for cancellation of entry clearance and permission
