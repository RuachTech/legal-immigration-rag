Immigration Rules Appendix Temporary Work – Creative Worker
===========================================================

The Temporary Work - Creative Worker route is for a person who wants to work within the creative sector.

The Temporary Work - Creative Worker route is for a person who wants to come to the UK to work within the creative sector.

A Creative Worker is someone who can make a unique contribution to the UK’s rich cultural life, for example, as an artist, dancer, musician or entertainer, or as a model contributing to the UK’s fashion industry.

A person can be granted permission for up to 12 months initially and can apply to extend their stay up to a maximum of two years if they are still working for the same sponsor. 

 A partner and children can apply as dependants on this route.

The Creative Worker route is not a route to settlement.
