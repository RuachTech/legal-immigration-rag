1.   65C. (a) In the case of an application where Table 8A or Table 9A applies, points for maintaining the level of investment for the specified continuous period of leave will only be awarded:

    1.   (i) if the applicant has purchased a portfolio of qualifying investments for a price of at least £2 million (or £5 million or £10 million, as appropriate); and
    2.   (ii) where any part of the qualifying investments in the portfolio is sold (whether at a gain or at a loss) during the specified continuous period of leave, their gross proceeds are re-invested in qualifying investments before the end of the next reporting period, or within six months of the date of completion of the sale, whichever is sooner.

The applicant must have invested £2.1 million at or by the time he pays these costs; he cannot pay out of a £2 million investment and invest a further £100,000 at a later date to compensate).

        1.   (i) Documents confirming the purchase of assets in the UK, showing the assets purchased, the value of these assets and the dates of purchase.

The valuation of the portion of the property that the applicant may rely on, must be provided in a report issued by a surveyor (who is a member of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors), which is dated not earlier than six months prior to the date of application.

        5.   (e) Evidence of the investment having been maintained, from the date that the funds were invested for the full period of remaining leave, will be determined using the portfolio reports provided in (a).
