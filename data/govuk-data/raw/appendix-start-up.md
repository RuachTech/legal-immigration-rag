Immigration Rules Appendix Start-up
===================================

The Start-up route is for a person seeking to establish a business in the UK for the first time. From 13 April 2023 this route is only available to those who hold a valid Start-up endorsement issued before the 13 April 2023. From 13 July 2023 the Start-up route will be closed to all new applications.

The person must have an innovative, viable and scalable business idea which is supported by an endorsing body approved by the Home Office.

A person on the Start-up route can bring a dependent partner and dependent children to the UK.
