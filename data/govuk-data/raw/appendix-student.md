Immigration Rules: Appendix Student
===================================

Student route

This route is for a person aged 16 or over who wants to study with a sponsor on a course of further or higher education, a pre-sessional English course, a recognised foundation programme or to take an elected post as a Student Union Sabbatical Officer.

The register of licensed student sponsors can be found at: [www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-of-licensed-sponsors-students)

A person who is aged 16 or 17 and wants to study with a sponsor that is an Independent School on a course at Regulated Qualifications Framework 3 or Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework 6 and above can apply as either a Student or as a Child Student (see Appendix Child Student).

A person who wants to study a course for 6 months or less without a student sponsor but with an accredited provider should apply under Appendix V: Visitor. A person aged 16 or over who wants to study an English Language course of 11 months or less without a student sponsor but with an accredited provider, should apply under Appendix Short-term Student.

Some Students can bring a dependent partner and dependent children to the UK, for example if they are studying at postgraduate level or on a government sponsored scheme.

The Student route is not a route to settlement.
